<h1><a href="/">Shovelglove</a> : Movements : Stoke the Oven</h1>

<p><a href="/nickelodeon.cgi?m=stoke_oven&amp;x=44">See video and stills</a></p>

<p>There are a number of ways to imagine this one, but here's what I
do: imagine you are in the engine car of and old fashioned steam
locomotive, stuffing coals into the furnace. Bend your kees, hold the
shovelglove perpendicular to your body, and turn so your face and one
foot are towards the imaginary oven, the other 90 degrees. Then lunge towards
it. Pull back. Repeat.</p>

<p>Another way to think of this movement is "stuff the cannon."
Imagine you've got one of those muzzel loading cannons from napoleonic
times into which you're ramming powder and shot.</p>

<p>Yet another, also martial, and perhaps even more satisfying way to
think of it is "thrust the spear." Thanks John Enzinas, for <a
href="/group/50.html">suggesting
this.</a> </p>

<p>Juergen from Austria takes the locomotive motif further and <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=3803">combines
this movement with shoveling</a>.</p>

<p>My unscientific pain-based analysis is that this movement hits the
forearms and abdomen most.</p>

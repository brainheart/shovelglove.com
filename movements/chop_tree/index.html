Subject: 	Re: [shovelglove] New Move for Abs
From: 	Reinhard Engels

Justin,

Your instructions are very clear, and besides seeming
physiologically effective, chop-the-tree fits in with
the shovelglove ethic perfectly. It's so obvious in
retrospect I'm surprised I didn't think of it myself.
I'll give it a try Monday. I've got 3 undocumented new
movements myself which need video. Maybe I can squeeze
chop-the-tree in this batch as well. And as the
inventor, maybe *you* want to supply the images or
video (no pressure).

Thank you! And congratulations on being the first
non-Reinhard to contribute a movement.

Reinhard

<p>I think Justin described it pretty clearly, but if you have more questions or want to read about other people's experiences with this move,
 see the shovelglove bulletin board  <a href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2376">discussion thread for chop tree</a>.</p>

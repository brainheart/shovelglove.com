<p>Just make like you're chopping wood <em>except</em> 1) aim higher,
well above the knee and 2) swing the shovelglove around in a circular
motion rather than jerking it straight back on the follow through.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's just the novelty, that my body is just not
used to it yet, but this one beats the hell out of me. I do maybe
20-25 reps, just one set [I moved to 50 after a couple of weeks]. The
high brake wrenches your gut muscles and I'm convinced I can see the
results of the twist in the mirror. My forearms turn to firejelly, and
it's macho-kid fun.</p>

<p>I'm especially fond of this exercise for another reason. Two weeks
after I started doing it, I managed to armwrestle my
50-pound-dumbbell-curling brother to a standstill (well, almost) for
the first time. Pre-shovelglove, he used to beat me like a nothing
girl; my resistance didn't even register.</p>

<p>I should mention that I use a prop, a cat scratching post, for the
fence post. If I ever get around to measuring it, I will post the
dimensions here.</li>

<p><font color="red">WARNING!</font> A shugger has <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=1260">reported
zinging his back</a> doing this movement. Please be even more careful
than usual doing this movement, and maybe consider not doing it until
you've built up your back muscles doing other movements for a few
months..</p>

Each week I generally do one olympic-style weightlifing workout, one 
bodyweight/calisthenic workout, and one freestyle workout (whatever I 
feel like). I take a Yoga class twice a week.

Originally I planned to do shovel-glove on my freestyle day, but last 
night before yoga I grabbed a little weight bar used for aerobics 
classes. I put a 10 # weight on one side and grabbed it like it was 
a shovel. I did about 10-15 minutes of shovelglove with the bar 
while waiting for the class instructor. It really warmed me up, and 
I got a great stretch during the class. I think that will definitely 
become a routine.

While I was doing this, I made up an exercise. I don't think I saw 
anything like it on your site, but I could be wrong. I spread my 
legs a little wider than shoulder width. Then bend forward at the 
waist while holding the bar (or sledge hammer) with my hands shoulder 
width or so. I turn my upper body away from the side that has the 
weight keeping the unweighted arm straight (it stays straight). Then 
I turn my upper body toward the side that is weighted while pulling 
the weighted hand to my chest (like a dumbell row). Drop the 
weighted hand, turn the upper body away from the weight, repeat. I 
did it about 15 times then switched sides.

I call this 'hauling the anchor', although I doubt that anyone 
actually hauls an anchor that way.

A few of the people in the class asked me what I was doing. I 
explained the concept and they seemed moderately interested. Maybe 
if I keep doing it they will join me.

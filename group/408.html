&gt; Hi Deb,
&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations! We had a bit too in Cambridge...
....A *bit*? I thought your guys had it bad?

&gt; I had pretty much same experience as last big
&gt; snowstorm, except it was noticeably easier this year
&gt; (though in fairness, I was less ambitious):

.....Fairness Shmairness, ambitious shmambitious! LOL :)
You have been slinging a 16 pounder around for the last year, give 
yourself credit where credit is due! :) You are an inspiration to us 
all! Right guys? Oh by the way, where the heck is all the &quot;pact&quot; 

these days... Oh yeah, too busy shovelgloving to write about it I 
guess... :)

&gt; You should have seen the contemptuous, pitying look I
&gt; shot my neighbor with the snowblower.

....Yes, I hate him already out of principle! Snowblowers! Feh...
My neighbor had the chutzpah to blow his snow all over our lawn, 
since he was upwind! Richard was taking cover in his igloo! :)
Thanks for the encouragement!
Peace,
Deb

Hi Deb. I thought it might be something like that - doing what you 
love doesn't bring in enough income, so you have to supplement w/a 
part time job...a lot of people have that situation. I have a 
question for you, since you're a professional: is it true that you 
have to hold a stretch for at least 15 seconds for it to have any 
effect? I think I read that somewhere.

Left arm is SLOWLY but surely getting better. It's definitely less 
stiff &amp; sore today. Now I just wish the !@#$% swelling would go 
away. I had ice on it for at least an hour last night. How long is 
too long for icing?

&gt; ...Well until last week I was barely working at all, for most of 
the 
&gt; Winter, as it was pretty slow, and I'd only do an occasional 
massage 
&gt; here and there.. Well clearly no one can live on such sporadic 
work 
&gt; so I had to get a supplemental income which would be 
predictable... 
&gt; Hence the &quot;Bozo&quot; comment, as my new boss where I am working now as 

a 
&gt; part time physical therapist aide, is an extreme weenie! It's 
much 
&gt; nicer, but poorer, to work for ones self!
&gt; Fortunately, that seems to be picking up slowly too and I am 
&gt; starting to see the &quot;fruits&quot; of my marketing efforts, and even 

&gt; starting to get referrals from other healthcare practitioners! Yay!
&gt; That reminds me, I used to have one of those punching bags kids 
use 
&gt; to get rid of frustration, which had Bozo the clowns face on it... 

I 
&gt; should just imagine this guy when I am doing Shovelglove and 
really 
&gt; get into it! LOL
&gt; Get better and maybe you should go and get a licensed massage 
&gt; therapist to give you a nice mushing!
&gt; Well gotta get some coffee and get my hammer a whacking!
&gt; Long Live the Pact of Blood!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

Hey Guys :)
Will someone please buy me a new car? LOL...
Or at least an exhaust...
We had quite a stressful evening yesterday, what with the snow, ice 
and wind gusting, which caused our power to go out for 2 or 3 hours..
I was making dinner while holding a flashlight over my spagetti!
To be honest it was a bit scary there for a little while because, 
firstly I get freaked out when there's no light, mildly, but 
nonetheless, enough to drain my batteries from stress.. then our 
heat doesn't work without the electicity for the thermostat, so I 
was thinking we would be very cold as the temps were in the teens 
last night...
The worst thing was I was in a huge rush to get to work, because I'm 
still not into the swing of getting up and going, and my car which 
has a gigantic hole in the front exhaust pipes was frozen, and I 
didn't leave myself enough time to defrost it with some hot water.. 
Could barely open the doors and cut my finger a bit yanking it open, 
but the windows were sealed shut... I was totally stupid to not just 
call in and say I'd be late by 10 minutes but I guess I was really 
worried I'd get fired (by bozo) so I drove with all the windows 
closed and all the carbon monoxide killing my brain cells...
I'm getting it taken care of very soon...
Meanwhile, I really don't feel up to doing anything right now, and I 
was just going to skip it, but I'm starting to feel sad about 
breaking my own promise to myself and my fellow metalheads, so I am 
going to do my SG anyways!
Probably I will go at a snails pace.. I feel like I've been 
drugged... And not the good kind of drugged!
As for tomorrow.. I am getting out the door way earlier to make sure 
I can get those windows open.
I hope you are all doing well and please send me a little prayer cuz 
today I just need it folks... Just one of those days...
Peace,
Deb

Have you ever read about cold water dousing it was
very popular in Europe and Asia in the 1800's and now
people are rediscovering it. It seems very intense.

&gt; &gt; Way to go Deb, Ive read studies where children
&gt; who are introduced 
&gt; to exercise at a young age develop better focus, and
&gt; discipline. 
&gt; Weighted crunches can be very good my advice try for
&gt; sets of five 
&gt; rather than a bunch of high rep sets. Keep rocking.
&gt; Richard
&gt; 
&gt; ....Yes I agree, sets of five are great..Thanks
&gt; Richard! :)
&gt; I am up to two sets so far! LOL :)
&gt; So my son is having a &quot;play date&quot;, with his friend
&gt; now... He wanted 
&gt; to show his friend the Shovelglove... So they came
&gt; in and he picked 
&gt; it up and said with a big smile &quot;Doesn't even hurt&quot;
&gt; with a cool 
&gt; delivery... I said &quot;I love this kid!&quot; and gave him a
&gt; big high 
&gt; five! :)
&gt; I did contrast bathing for my arms last night... Wow
&gt; there is 
&gt; nothing like ice massage to get the blood flowing,
&gt; but it is painful 
&gt; I say.... Wanna test your pain threshhold guys? Ice
&gt; your forearms 
&gt; and see if you aren't biting your lips and gritting
&gt; your teeth by a 
&gt; few minutes.... Only go as long as it takes to get
&gt; numb, if you make 
&gt; it that long.... then contrast bathe it with nice
&gt; hot water (not 
&gt; scalding be careful, the ice does interfere with
&gt; your temperature 
&gt; perception and you can injure the tissue) but then
&gt; always end with 
&gt; ice. I can't really explain the feeling this causes
&gt; very well, but 
&gt; you will be looking at your arms by the end and
&gt; wondering if they 
&gt; have changed into giant chili peppers they get so
&gt; red! The feeling 
&gt; is like a refreshed and free feeling... I totally
&gt; recommend this to 
&gt; all of you guys! If you try it please let me know
&gt; how you liked 
&gt; it. Remember to use a disposable dixie cup to make
&gt; the ice, as 
&gt; icecubes will be gone within less than a minute and
&gt; don't really 
&gt; cover much surface area...Also, keep the ice moving
&gt; the whole time, 
&gt; don't just let it stay on one spot...use circular
&gt; movements to 
&gt; massage the tight spots and especially the common
&gt; flexor and 
&gt; extensor tendons.....I needed that so bad yesterday
&gt; as I was letting 
&gt; stuff build up for a long time and the cold weather
&gt; around here is 
&gt; really causing everything to feel tight anyway....It
&gt; helped a lot 
&gt; and reduced my pain considerably....And it's pretty
&gt; much free.. No 
&gt; creams or expensive formulas to buy...just ice!
&gt; Hope everyone is having a great weekend!
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb

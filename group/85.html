Thanks for posting this, gtmcfar. Comments

&gt; Originally I planned to do shovel-glove on my
&gt; freestyle day, but last 
&gt; night before yoga I grabbed a little weight bar used
&gt; for aerobics 
&gt; classes. I put a 10 # weight on one side and
&gt; grabbed it like it was 
&gt; a shovel. I did about 10-15 minutes of shovelglove
&gt; with the bar 

My brother also does shovelglove as a supplement to
his regular (freeweight) workout rather than just by
itself. He says it's 1) a fun break 2) a good way to
hit all those oddball muscles that his conventional
more focused movements miss. While I'd originally
intended shovelglove as a replacement exercise for
people (like myself) who haven't been able to stick
with a conventional routine, from what I'm hearing it
does pretty well in an auxiliary role too.

&gt; While I was doing this, I made up an exercise. I
&gt; don't think I saw 
&gt; anything like it on your site, but I could be wrong.
&gt; I spread my 
&gt; legs a little wider than shoulder width. Then bend
&gt; forward at the 
&gt; waist while holding the bar (or sledge hammer) with
&gt; my hands shoulder 
&gt; width or so. I turn my upper body away from the
&gt; side that has the 
&gt; weight keeping the unweighted arm straight (it stays
&gt; straight). Then 
&gt; I turn my upper body toward the side that is
&gt; weighted while pulling 
&gt; the weighted hand to my chest (like a dumbell row). 
&gt; Drop the 
&gt; weighted hand, turn the upper body away from the
&gt; weight, repeat. I 
&gt; did it about 15 times then switched sides.
&gt; 
&gt; I call this 'hauling the anchor', although I doubt
&gt; that anyone 
&gt; actually hauls an anchor that way.
&gt; 

I don't worry too much about verisimilitude. If the
image inspires you, that's enough (though if there are
any actual farmers/sailors/soldiers/hunter-gatherers
in this group, I'd love to hear from you). You're
right that there's nothing like this movement on the
site yet. I'll have to give it a try. Might make a
good component exercise in a nautical &quot;Master and
Commander&quot; scenario.

&gt; A few of the people in the class asked me what I was
&gt; doing. I 
&gt; explained the concept and they seemed moderately
&gt; interested. Maybe 
&gt; if I keep doing it they will join me.

You are a bold man! Let us know if you make any
converts.

Reinhard

&gt; Reinhard! I am *still* rolling in the aisles from
&gt; that one!!!

I'm glad you liked it, but it looks like 1290 people
got to the term first...

(some ambiguity as to whether it refers to cars or
self)

&gt; You really have to write more blog for us :)

I'm really pressed for time right now and make it a
point to actually practice my systems before writing
about them :-). The practice part is going well, but
there's not much time left over. Work is busy, kid is
busier, and we're down an income so obsessing over
finances takes a lot of time. I need to read (books) a
bit or I go crazy. Diddling on the internet is hard to
make a priority... and the groups seem to have gotten
pretty self sustaining without me constantly posting.
I should have a bit more time soon though once I get
some other side projects wrapped up (like the yahoo
groups replacement, which I haven't forgotten about,
and do spend a fair amount of time diddling with, and
will be heavily optimized for me to do maximum &quot;blog&quot;
in minimum time).

&gt; Hey! And what about that little line on your page
&gt; where you say you 
&gt; will be posting a 2005, 6 , 7 etc.. photo eh? 

Hey, 2005 isn't over. I have an idea for this year's
shot that requires some more procrastination and a
little extra capital expenditure.

P.S. Thanks for the stretch info. I do pay pretty
close attention to my body, so if anything feels
slightly out of whack, I'll give it a closer read. I
still can't get over 1) how fine I feel without
stretching 2) how there is no &quot;everyday&quot; precedent for
it in the daily routines of our
hunter/farmer/homemaker ancestors, so far as I'm aware
(the question wasn't entirely rhetorical).

&quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot;, by German Philosopher Eugen
Herrigel.. I'll try to find a copy.

By the way, I'm doing more shovelgloving than tire-striking lately - 
mostly because it's been raining so I moved to the basement. I'm 
finding that my shoulder is feeling better (it doesn't hurt during 
the day, although my range of motion still bites). I think I'm 
probably strengthening my weak rotator cuff muscles. If I could just 
get the range of motion back, I'd be all set. Still, less pain and 
more strength is better. One should be grateful.

&gt; &gt; Gotta admit, the only Zen book I've ever read is the one about
&gt; &gt; motorcycle maintenance. And, clearly, that doesn't count. I'm 

sure 
&gt; I misused the word. My bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Kevin, it ain't no biggie, props to you for using the word at 

&gt; all! Most people use the term having only a vague guess of what it 

&gt; means...In a really oversimplified nutshell, Zen consciousness is 

&gt; that spiritual state of true equanimaty. Not really trying to 
&gt; achieve something, just letting the process unfold, being at one 
&gt; with your task at hand. My best moments when I am doing a massage 

&gt; are these isolated moments when I am not &quot;doing&quot; it, but rather 

&gt; being so much in the moment that rather I am allowing the process 

to 
&gt; unfold, and not trying to impose myself or my will...I am letting 

&gt; the famous &quot;force&quot; of Star Wars fame, to flow through me.
&gt; The classic Japanese example, in archery, is to wonder whether the 

&gt; archer is shooting the target or is it the target hitting the 
archer?
&gt; The Pirsig book is a real fave of mine too, and does count, in some 

&gt; way as well...The main character's &quot;maintenence&quot; of all the little 

&gt; tuneups and repairs of his motorcycle, being such an extension of 

&gt; himself, is pretty Zen actually. Whatever you do in life can 
become 
&gt; a Zen experience, even mundane things, especially, such as digging 

a 
&gt; hole, doing the dishes, what have you. But the Japanese have 
&gt; cultivated ways of actually achieving this through the ritualized 

&gt; practice of certain arts, practice to the point where stuff 
&gt; just &quot;happens&quot;, without trying, totally automatically, and it is no 

&gt; longer possible to distinguish between the shot, the target, and 
the 
&gt; archer...*Trust* me, the book is much better than anything I could 

&gt; say on the topic. What is most interesting is to see how the author 

&gt; had to wrestle with letting go of so many Western preconceptions 
and 
&gt; un-do alot of stuff which was interfering with his real mastery, 
&gt; mainly his ego and his will...It was not easy for him to do and he 

&gt; narrates his journey through all of his &quot;successes&quot; and 
&quot;failures&quot; 
&gt; So go to the source, it's required reading :) I believe that you 
&gt; will enjoy it :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the tire info...I will let you know if I start doing it!
&gt; 
&gt; Again on Zen, there is a great quote from one of my favorite 
movies, 
&gt; Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It's the scene where the protagonist 

&gt; sword master, after years of studying meditation and martial arts, 

&gt; says during a fight sequence in which he is clearly in complete 
&gt; control:
&gt; &quot;Real Sharpness comes without effort&quot; 
&gt; Not to make too much of a stretch, but even our SG and Diet efforts 

&gt; made on a daily basis could be considered to be a very ritualized 

&gt; practice as well, eventually becoming largely unconscious in the 
end.
&gt; 
&gt; Chop wood, carry water, grasshopper&quot; :)
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb

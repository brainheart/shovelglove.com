But they didn't, so there (LOL)
Call me a purist, or just plain picky, but I wouldn't choose to buy 
a fiberglass shell guitar(sorry Ovation), or an axe or a hammer made 
with anything but wood...I think it's the solid feeling...like 
choosing a wooden bat over aluminum in baseball, yes the aluminum is 
very light, but wood has some organic appeal about it 
and now I think we are getting a bit obsessive, so let's just say...
I like wood.

&gt; &gt; I have a heavy bag....
&gt; &gt; Do you mean a big punching bag?
&gt; yes
&gt; &gt; 
The only punching bag I ever had was a Bozo the Clown kiddie 
bag...Same rationale I think...Worked off excess stress and 
frustration (take that Bozo!) I think shovelglove will help in that 
arena!

&gt; &gt; Try boxing gloves :)
&gt; I use heavy bag gloves or handwraps, and it stillhurts. It is 
like hitting
&gt; concrete 

Sand is the main ingredient in concrete, so this makes sense...I 
guess you are masochistic by nature LOL :)
Have fun,
Debbie
PS. are you doing SG on it's own, or are you doing it in conjunction 
with No S and urban ranger too?

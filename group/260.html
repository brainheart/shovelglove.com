Hi Shugsters!
Debster here :)
So the &quot;take the whole weekend off from SG&quot; phenomenon happened 

again yesterday...I was so rusty feeling, after skipping two 
consecutive days, that SG was really not fun...I felt very sluggish 
and I think that it's because of that.
Also, I really like doing SG and having to totally skip it, because 
of the &quot;weekends off&quot; convention, feels like I am forcing myself 

*not* to do something I really like...What really seems to be most 
life friendly for me is doing it every day, unless I am scheduled 
for a very busy day of massage, and only taking off days if I am 
unusually sore for some reason. Lately with my kind of &quot;schedule&quot; if 

you could even suggest that it *is* a schedule, the way it is 
structured, I have lot's of free time so 14 minutes of swinging the 
steel is perfectly easy to maintain daily. The bad feeling of being 
so sluggish and rusty, is not something I wish to face again...I eat 
every day, why not exercise everyday too? Reinhard if you think 
there is a fatal flaw in my reasoning I would be more than happy for 
your feedback :)
Have a grrrrrrrreat day!
Deb

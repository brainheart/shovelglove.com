Thanks guys for the tips and encouragement. I guess I am having 
mental blocks. When I started this journey back in August of last 
year, I weight 191 pounds and looked like a stuff polish sausage!

I have been taking measurements, because I knew that this tricky 
correlation existed. I also have taken before pictures, and progress 
pictures. I SEE the difference.

So I am down to 149. And that is still, according to every chart, 
doctor and whatever, not really a healthy weight for me. And I felt 
my best when I was around 130. So that's what I am aiming for.

Will the body eventually catch up then? I mean, I don't think I'll 
ever have so much muscle that it'd be reasonable to weight 150 and be 
fit?

Or is there some test for body fat and this and that, which can tell 
me, based on my muscle and bone size - what is a good, reasonable and 
muscled weight to set out for, that'd solve a lot for me.

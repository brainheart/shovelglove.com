Well.
I just spent 20 straight minutes exacto knifing off all that tape...
Let me just say, that as for holding the rock in place.. it would 
have! LOL I think that if you put enough of it, duct tape is 
probably as strong as titanium! LOL :)
I had to remove the tape by cutting chunks off that then resmbled 
triangles of duct tape pita when taken off... and in most spots it 
was a full quarter inch thick... This glove could have held up a 
small South American republic!
I could have used it for stirrups or a back yard swing! And it would 
have held both you and I up together Reinhard! LOL.....
Needless to say... and to reiterate a bit, I do thank you for your 
friendly guidance... It confirmed an intuitive worry/thought (the 
handle issue) which I had too, and I wasn't listening to myself...
We all know what happens when we ignore that important inner guide...
Thanks again Reinhard...
Whoever invented Duct tape is awesome! Probably some person at 3M...
That stuff looked like it could have preserved a mummy!
Well the surgery went great and the rock is doing fine...
Hey now I have a good paperweight for my desk!
Love,
Dr. Deb...

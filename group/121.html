Welcome, Kai.

Don't get too antsy about getting a heavier sledge.
It's probably good to start a little too light, just
to get the movements down and build some muscle tone.
Long term, the few weeks or months that you weren't
going at maximum capacity are likely to be much less
of a problem than the danger that overdoing it you'll
strain yourself and quit altogether. As with no-s,
building the framework of the habit, carving out that
14 minute block every weekday, is the most important
thing up front. If you stood around and looked at a
stopwatch for 14 minutes each morning, it would be
progress.

Maybe we'll bump into each other urban rangering
around Boston some time. These days my route is
Central Square -&gt; Longwood -&gt; Kendall Square -&gt;
Central Square.

Looking forward to impressions and pictures,

Reinhard

&gt; Hey all -
&gt; 
&gt; Like many, I've known about shovelglove for awhile
&gt; now, but it took
&gt; some time for me to actually start doing it. I
&gt; started today (a Monday
&gt; instead of the recommended Wednesday) and feel
&gt; pretty good,
&gt; considering how long my body has been on a downward
&gt; spiral of geek
&gt; atrophy. :) I'm sure I'll be sore soon enough, but
&gt; I'm determined to
&gt; keep at it. I've always been an urban ranger and
&gt; have been following
&gt; the equivalent of the NOSdiet for some time now
&gt; (although it's more
&gt; like I keep myself too busy to even think about
&gt; food: geek &quot;diet&quot;), so
&gt; I'm okay on those fronts. I'm working on an
&gt; intentional diet (healthy
&gt; maintainence diet, not weight loss diet) for myself,
&gt; though, because
&gt; while I'm not fat, I definitely need to eat
&gt; *smarter* (i.e. get more
&gt; greens &amp; good vitamins).
&gt; 
&gt; I have no time available to commute to the gym, so
&gt; this 14 minute
&gt; system works great for me. More importantly, the
&gt; concept of mimicking
&gt; useful manual labor movements just *makes sense* and
&gt; is something I
&gt; can feel good about. I never was a fan of all that
&gt; wacky gym
&gt; machinery! I'm on a 8lb sledge right now because I
&gt; had one readily
&gt; available, but I have a feeling I'll bump up to a 12
&gt; after I get past
&gt; the initial hump of waking up my poor muscles.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll post again with my first week impressions and a
&gt; photo of my sg
&gt; (just for the halibut).
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, Reinhard!
&gt; 
&gt; - Kai, 5'5&quot; 23/m from Boston

Hi Folks! What's shakin?
Well on Tuesday while leaving Barnes and Noble with Richie.. I 
spazzed out as we were walking into the parking lot... He did this 
quick movement and jumped over a low lying shrubbery....So for a 
moment my mind got distracted and my foot eye coordination went 
kablooie... So as I stepped over the curb I started to twist my 
ankle, but caught myself, as I often do, right on the edge... My 
reflexes are lightning fast, but this time they could have been 
faster.. I definitely felt a tiny groin/adductor pull from the 
abrupt &quot;yanking&quot; out of allignment... I've also been climbing stairs 

every day.. today was 18... one set of 10 this am and 8 more before 
shovelgloving just now as a warm up...
Seems my left knee has been &quot;twinging&quot; every now and then, since 

that ankle twist... So I took the last minute of SG to use the 
weight to apply pressure to the quads and all around the knee cap...
This is a fantastic way to self massage those quads... just gently 
roll the head back and forth perpendicular to the muscles fiber 
direction (quads go up and down) and &quot;voila&quot; you are giving yourself 

cross fiber friction massage!
Man were my quads screaming! LOL....
Hey Allan, if you are there, hope you liked the tunes, and good 
hearing from you... Does your son work out too? Golden Eagle Kung 
Fu sounds cool! As for me, the only Martial Art I know is an 
internal &quot;quiet style&quot; Qi Gong or Chi Kung... (different spelling 

for the same sound estimations...)
I should be doing more of that these days, but I get sidetracked by 
Life... I try to squeeze it in whenever I feel stressed or just am 
thinking of it... They are exercises which cultivate your Chi and 
help to balance Yin and Yang... within your body, a microcosm of the 
macrocosm.....
I rented the last Samurai today and I'm sure it'll be great... But 
as I said on NoS... My favorite Samurai is John Belushi!
Peace All Warriors! (that seems highly oxymoronic! LOL)
Love,
Deb :)

Heck, even using a jack hammer to bust up a slab is hard!

It's a very different feel to actually hit something than to 
shovelglove. I pound a tire as part of my workout, as well as 
shovelgloving. I think shovelgloving is harder on the muscles, and 
hitting something is more aerobic. Or maybe you can go faster, so 
it's more aerobic. In any event, I do both.

Doing real work is another thing again. It's definitely harder to dig 
a hole than it is to shovelglove. That said, it's much easier to dig 
a hole now that I've been shovelgloving. It's all the distracting, 
non-Zen, aspects of digging a real hole (dirt, rocks, roots) that 
make it harder.

&gt; The 20# sledge came out of retirement as a tool today. I got to 
smash up my friend's concrete pad. The project had a bit different 
feel than &quot;shugging,&quot; as the swing to get the beast to crack the 

concrete was about as Max Effort as something with so much 
leverage/acceleration can be. I found the old boxing trick works (if 
any of you are called upon to smash concrete for some reason), in 
this case, swing through the point of impact. It worked. If you get 
a chance, I highly recommend actually using the hammer now and then. 
It gives you a very satisfied feeling about all the work you put into 
shuggin'. But that's just my take on it. Have fun.

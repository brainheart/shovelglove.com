&gt; Okay, so who, besides Reinhard, has been keeping up with SG? Speak
&gt; now or have your &quot;oven stoked&quot; LOL
&gt; Did you all go away to another Shovelglove website? LOL...
&gt; Who's still around? :)

OK, I admit it.. I've been lagging.. for over a week. However, I must
also admit, Deb, that your enthusiasm got me back on track. So, thank
you!

I SG'ed yesterday, and today as well. And plan on it tomorrow. Have
also been walking quite a bit (thanks, Urban Ranger!) The post office
is a quarter mile away.. I walk there whenever possible. The grocery
store and my bank are a half mile away, I walk there often as well, as
I did today. Sometimes I bring my heavyhands along. I bought a cheap
(really cheap) pedometer on eBay.. I think I might get a better one at
some time, but at least it works. I also bought a heart monitor on
eBay, too.. that should be interesting (I'll bet SG really gets the
heart rate up there!)

My mom walked in on me tonight, while I was SGing (shovelgloving?) and
laughed. So, I will lock the door from now on. I guess I'm
self-conscious like that. Although, I must admit, it's probably pretty
funny to see a guy swinging a sledgehammer around and not hitting
anything. :) (For which I'm sure she was probably really thankful -
the not hitting anything part).

Does anyone here SG for more than the recommended 14 minutes? I
usually don't, because by about 11 minutes I'm looking at my watch and
praying the next 3 minutes will go by quickly.. but I'm thinking of
perhaps doing it twice a day, though that might be overkill. I don't
want to burn out, either.

My favorite moves are the shovel, driving fenceposts, and chopping
wood. I can feel those the most.

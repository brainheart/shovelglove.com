Oh, yes, you bet I've ridden the injury train! It was a hip flexor/SIJ issue two 
years back(working with a pitchfork, no less!). It took an embarrassingly long time 
to fix, after which, to deadlift 225 was all I could do. Live and learn. Lots of 
trips to the chiro, some massage, ice, stretching of different sorts, and I learned a 
lot about body awareness, repair, form and tension. The SG was respected and today, I 
am not sore (I have a very physically active life), save for a bit in the paws and 
midback. The SG demands respect, for the very reasons you mention, and that's why I 
kept my core (and everything else, really) tight throughout. I also made sure that if 
my body pivotted, my feet did as well, and kept my back nice and flat. Otherwise, 
with a 20# sledge it'd be lights out for me!

My grip is freaking distroyed worse than I could imagine!

Hey Storm, (cool name btw)
As I have mentioned in various occasions, I am a massage therapist.
When my partner the chiropractor, worked on me we had been 
discussing how the actually pounds of force are increased when a 
person has their head forward of their shoulders...each inch infront 
of the shoulders increases the force of pull on the muscles by 
roughly 10 times...eg: the head weighs like 9 lbs or so, and when it 
is one inch too far forward it's pull is ten times that, etc...
Try putting 20 lbs 30 inches in front of you and imagine the force 
that exerts on the body..well you don't have to imagine any more 
since you experienced your world of pain today. LOL
This is a nice way to herniate those precious discs, especially C2 
in your neck, so I know you are a big burly manly man, but please be 
very cautious. 14 mins of glory are not worth a possible 9 months 
out of commission. And as far as I can guess, shovelglovving is 
probably not covered under workmans comp! 
I think even 16 lbs is a huge hammer..
Clearly the last guy who used the sledge must have been Paul Bunyan!
Have fun anyway, certainly don't mean to nag, just friendly 
concern :)

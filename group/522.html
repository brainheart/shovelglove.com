&gt; Yes, I found the pic and it's great! But what is that stuff off to 

&gt; Reinhard's right? (the red &amp; yellow)

It's *supposed* to be a cape, but I have some perspective issues 
with drawing! LOL :)
The SR is for
Tada!
Super Reinhard!!!
Thanks Ariel :)
I have yet to hear from you Reinhard.. I'm assuming you are amused 
by my rendition of you... Please show it to your wife and daughter 
and see if they laugh!
The other picture, Forbidden Love, is my other one there.. It's 
supposed to be of Lokityrus aka Richard.... He has this &quot;thing&quot; for 

hammers you know.. Likes to do Shovelglove with a 20 lb hammer at 5 
in the morning! Hardcore :) LOL
You Rock too Richard! Yay!
LOL :)

Ariel, you should just respect the cues your body is giving you... 
if you can't do 5 days a week right away then do as much as you feel 
you can... it will eventually build up and you won't even notice it 
as it becomes part of your lifestyle.... As I said before, there 
were plenty of weeks last year when I would only do say, 3 or even 2 
times a week... I really started to get regular by around December, 
and then I made my New Years pact of Blood resolution which has been 
unbroken since! Also, remember that I have been &quot;kneading&quot; bodies 

for three years now, if you include the time I was in school too, 
and that got my hands and wrist flexors and extensors pretty toned 
to begin with... You don't want to have the glove go flying through 
a window or into your temporal lobes, so listen carefully to your 
body and workout when you are not tired, to reduce the chance of 
hurting yourself or spazzing out (even Reinhard has had his day 
in &quot;ouchland&quot; when he hit himself in the face with the handle, but 

no one was at work that day so he couldn't show off his shiner to 
anyone! Except his wife who laughed at him! LOL)
Well enjoy your day of rest.. I'm starting again tomorrow (sorry if 
that's sacrilegious :)
Love,
Deb

Storm Fox. Cool name, but you might have missed your calling. It's a 
perfect name for a weatherman ...

&gt; Whoah, there, I wouldn't call myself a high-end user, but am 
thrilled anyone would imagine me as such. Just to prove that I'm not 
bragging, because I'm hoping I didn't come off as someone trying to 
say that he is a seasoned, hard as nails diesel bulldog. In fact, 
how's this for humble beginnings?

&gt; That is my first and most recent competition. And, you can see 
that I am using my real name! If possible, I'll try to get a pic of 
some cool event training, gym stuff, and/or the various sledges we 
have around. By the way, a friend of mine has a big concrete pad 
behind his barn and he can't break it with his (admittedly, very 
cool) fancy 11.5# high-tech sledge. Well, magnanimous or not, I like 
the idea of taking the 20 out for a spin.

&gt; Thanks for clarifying, storm fox. I'm psyched that a
&gt; &quot;high end user&quot; such as yourself is getting something
&gt; out of shovelglove. Don't forget to give it a mention
&gt; if you win any awards. Maybe in a year or two I'll
&gt; join you at 20#.

&gt; &gt; First, some background on myself:
&gt; &gt; 1-I have worked in a feed store for about 5 years,
&gt; &gt; lifting, loading, throwing bags of feed, pushing and
&gt; &gt; pulling feed carts, you get the picture.
&gt; &gt; 2-I have always been a fan of old school stuff
&gt; &gt; (sandbags, heavy 1-hand lifting, Steve Justa type
&gt; &gt; stuff, etc.)
&gt; &gt; 3-I am training for strongman competitions (yes,
&gt; &gt; that's right, like on ESPN, but with much smaller
&gt; &gt; weights, I'm a novice!) and had my arse handed to me
&gt; &gt; in competition.
&gt; &gt; 4-I weigh a solid, athletic 195# (okay, I have a bit
&gt; &gt; of bellyfat, but not much)
&gt; &gt; 5-I do lots of heavy core work (135# sidebends, Ab
&gt; &gt; Wheel while standing, hanging leg raises, etc).
&gt; &gt; 6-I have decent amounts of experience chopping wood,
&gt; &gt; shovelling, prying, using 16# hammers, etc.
&gt; &gt; 7-I am perhaps more than a little crazy (my
&gt; &gt; neighbors will verify with stories of tire flipping
&gt; &gt; workouts in the driveway).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just wanted everyone to know, like Reinhard
&gt; &gt; suggested, the 20# sledge was picked in part because
&gt; &gt; family history with it, partly because I have a
&gt; &gt; different background and goals than most here, and
&gt; &gt; because 16# is relatively familiar. So, yes, for
&gt; &gt; the vast majority of people, an 8# sledge is PLENTY.
&gt; &gt; The idea is not to destroy yourself, but to do a
&gt; &gt; bit more than is routine, and something that will
&gt; &gt; have a tonic effect on body, mind and soul.

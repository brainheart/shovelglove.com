having another look at your email i decided to add that besides being not that much 
of a morning person... i am not much of a talker before noon.. and i dont eat 
anything before 12pm-2pm.. and so if i cant get such minor activities done in the 
&quot;late morning&quot; and &quot;early noon&quot;.. then i certainly cant get 
anything remotely resembling exercise done before that time...
don't feel bad about it.. try shovelgloving in ur own appropriate time..
i usually just do it anytime.. but i set a dead line for doing it.. that is 10:45 
pm.. if it's not done by then.. then SG till 11 pm it is.... 
well that's all i wanted to add...
ps:what do u think of Flamenco shoveling he he he :)

Hey guys. Caught up on posts to try and get some inspiration. I 
have my lovely hammer all situated and resting against my closet 
door. Crying out for attention! It's so pretty how it turned out, 
I need to take a picture of it - I think I even want to name it! 
Ohh, Athena. Nice strong name yah. Anyway... (Wow, I am goofy 
today)

I had intended to wake up 15 minutes early every morning to do this, 
and I tried once. I apparently, have no energy or physical strength 
in the morning. I wake up at 7:40 - brush teeth, get dressed, brush 
hair and shoes. Then out the door. Maybe I am not giving myself 
enough time to wake up and get the blood pumping, but I don't want 
to wake up even earlier to do this. 

So I've ended up not doing much at all. At most, I've lasted about 
6 minutes and stopped before any real effort could be put into it. 
I feel awful! 

After work, I hurry home for dinner. Or, if it's not a gym workout 
day, I play some DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for some at home 
cardio. I can't seem to find a good time to fit Shovelglove into 
my schedule. 

Help!

Other than that, things are going well. I just can't wait till I 
get nice, sleek and toned arms and back. I may even be able to get 
into a tank top this summer!

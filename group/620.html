now i am absolutely offended
and i reeeeeeeeeeeally have to voice my opinion..... try look sexist up in the 
dictionary... and try as well looking up for &quot;chauvinist&quot; while ur at 
it...
and come on..... harem in the 21st century? what part of Morocco have u been living 
in... and nabil, maybe in ur part of the world u dont get sued for staring at a woman 
s breast... but u certainly receive a slap on ur face for it ( that is if she wasnt 
followed by one of her male relatives)\
now i know how u keep wandering the streets in search for a fight...! (as u 
previously mentioned)
i am deeply offended, and i am sure every woman in here is too... and u really should 
apologize or i d personally cease all future contact with u .. i dont want to seem 
that aggressive... but in my part of the world that s how things are..
u simply are way off the main stream of this group
ps: how many wives did ur father have at the same time??? i dont suppose four.. and 
neither will u... my father is Egyptian (another part of the world where men are 
allowed to have four wives) and he s only ever married my mother... same as for all 
my uncles
dee
sorry Reinhard for adapting such an attitude, but i am deeply offended and couldn't 
keep my mouth shut....

Well, Im from a part of the world where men are allowed to have 4 
wifes... So I dont know what sexist means really... Belly dancers... 
Harems... :) hehe 

Im going to have to ask my north American counterpart what sexist 
means, I have heard they get sued for looking at a womans breasts :)

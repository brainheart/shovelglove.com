I have officially pricked my finger and entered into the cyber-pact.
I did a solid 14 minutes yesterday and will do so today. 
I have a 10 pounder. It was the only one I could find in the small town I live near. 
And I am trying to follow Reinhard's Regime. 

I think I am digging a farm pond. I live in a rural area, and a farm pond is to a 
swimming pool as rural living is to urban living. I should have it dug by summer. 


Thanks and best wishes.
Joe.

Yay! A pact :) The last time I did that I was 15!
This is truly doable and once I do it I really enjoy it, so those 
excuses and crap are over now...Same for my eating...
I just read the funniest book when I was at Barnes and Shnoble.. It 
was called something like &quot;Shut up, quit whining, change your life&quot;
by Larry Winget....It is a less polite version of some of Reinhards 
philosophies, and a real pisser, although in a very different 
voice....Basically he was saying &quot;get out of your comfort zone&quot; and 

to stop whining! Well friends whining to yourself, really gets old, 
so I'm glad I have decided to stop.... If I post to excess, sorry in 
advance, but in a way, that really helps me stay on track... You 
know, like reporting in.... The chat room really sucks on NoS 
because no one is ever on at the same time, so I just gave up on 
that.. Plus, Reinhard isn't there, and hey he's the NoS driving 
force so that makes it lame :)! ... I would be thrilled if people 
here, at least, reported in, say once a week? Just to keep the SG 
group pulse alive :) Thanks Joe for chiming in... What type of 
sledge do you use? Are you doing Reinhards Regime? Or are you 
creating your own 14 minute thing?
If Hendrix was a part of our Yahoo group he might have written this:
&quot;Hey Joe, where you goin with that sledge in your hand....&quot; LOL
(okay corny, I know, that's me :)
Hey you could use that for SG inspirational music!
I am hereby pricking my finger and making a cyber-pact of blood with 
you Joe, Rein, Art, and all you guys out there still wielding the 
hammer.
Even though it's New Years Day and Saturday, I am getting out my 
twelver now and putting on some Dead! Good way to start the year and 
seal the pact :)
Peace,
Deb

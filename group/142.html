Hi Debbie,

Not to be a crass sexist and reinforce the boy's
locker room ambiance, but 12 pounds might be a little
much. I started at 12 pounds but I'm kind of a big
dude, over six feet, and, as I was fond of pointing
out when I was fat, &quot;big boned.&quot;

That being said, I'm thrilled to have a second(?)
member of the deadliest of the species in this group,
and I'd be delighted to be proved wrong -- just please
don't kill yourself trying to delight me.

Be careful, and keep us posted,

Reinhard

&gt; I feel like I am in the boys locker room!
&gt; Without the &quot;fragrance&quot;
&gt; From the looks of the previous posts, with the
&gt; exceptions of some 
&gt; people named &quot;MT&quot; and the very mysterious &quot;D&quot;, 
this
&gt; group seems like 
&gt; its all menfolk...That's OK I was the only girl in
&gt; little league 
&gt; when I was nine. I stunk but it was fun to be around
&gt; all that 
&gt; testosterone :)
&gt; 
&gt; I bought my sledge today. Tomorrow I will try it on
&gt; for size :)
&gt; 12 lb &quot;Collins Axe&quot; brand, made in Lewistown PA, USA
&gt; No yellow fiberglass for me thankyou very much. Wood
&gt; is good.
&gt; I am ready to bash up the world
&gt; Grrrrrrrrrr! LOL :)
&gt; I am very very psyched!
&gt; 
&gt; Now where was that old sweater the moths liked so
&gt; much?
&gt; I have already decided on perfect shovelglove
&gt; music,,,,
&gt; Led Zeppelin I...Cranked up to 11 :)
&gt; 
&gt; At the hardware store today the guy behind me
&gt; stepped away from the 
&gt; counter when he saw me standing there waiting in
&gt; line...I think I'm 
&gt; enjoying that powerful feeling already
&gt; Supergirl Away!
&gt; 
&gt; I read the post where Rein talked about going up
&gt; from 12 to 16, and 
&gt; how the fact that the weight is on the end of a
&gt; stick makes a big 
&gt; difference in the force of the pull, well not
&gt; exactly those words. 
&gt; That is really true. When I compared just holding
&gt; them side by side, 
&gt; without swinging them around, it was very
&gt; noticeable. So I will 
&gt; probably just stick with 12 and I am sure it will
&gt; give me a doozie 
&gt; of a workout.
&gt; I am starting tomorrow morning. I think I will
&gt; develop my own 
&gt; routine, but, of course it will be 14 mins. Maybe
&gt; even try to make 
&gt; up some new moves :)
&gt; 
&gt; I actually LIKE shovelling snow for real, as long as
&gt; I'm not in a 
&gt; hurry or something, but with SG the difference here
&gt; is the &quot;snow&quot; 
&gt; isn't gonna get tossed to the side and I'm going to
&gt; have to be much 
&gt; more careful about not jerking to an abrupt halt, or
&gt; flinging the 
&gt; damn thing through the wall.
&gt; This should really help me with self maintence/care
&gt; for my work, so 
&gt; it has an added very useful perk...For those of you
&gt; who haven't met 
&gt; me yet, I am a licensed massage therapist...My
&gt; forearms are already 
&gt; pretty strong, from all that massage, and I know all
&gt; about body 
&gt; mechanics, and leaning in, proper leverage, etc...
&gt; Oh and I have already made a safety modification to
&gt; the shovelling 
&gt; motion seen on Mr. E's video sample, which is to
&gt; grip the far end of 
&gt; the handle at the very end &quot;cupping it&quot; so to speak,
&gt; because this 
&gt; helps stabilize the whole thing during the &quot;tossing&quot;
&gt; phase of the 
&gt; movement, and the weight has a counter weight, or
&gt; force on the end 
&gt; of the stick. If this is cheating somewhat, so be
&gt; it. It's all 
&gt; about leverage folks, leverage and balance.
&gt; 
&gt; So, arms are pretty strong already, but one thing I
&gt; really don't 
&gt; exercise is my stomach, and low back. And boys (and
&gt; women if you are 
&gt; there, give a holler) let me tell you, when one
&gt; gives birth to an 
&gt; 11lb, baby, and have gained as much as I have, going
&gt; up and down 
&gt; repeatedly, over the last 10 years (lowest around
&gt; 160, highest 215) 
&gt; that mid section takes on a very flabby life of it's
&gt; own...I 
&gt; absolutely abhor situps so I really hope that SG
&gt; helps get rid of 
&gt; this kangaroo pouch.
&gt; PS I will try to make my future posts here at SG
&gt; central,less 
&gt; lengthy, as it will interfere with my allotted SG
&gt; time, and just 
&gt; give me another bad reason to sit on my ass.
&gt; Wish me luck, and good luck to all you shovelling
&gt; fools :)
&gt; Peace and Grunting,
&gt; Debbie
&gt; If I am not back after 14 minutes send help :)

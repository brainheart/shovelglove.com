Hi Reinhard,

Thanks so much for the informative reply. You were wise to start 
gradually. In hindsight, it seems obvious how foolish I was to start 
with a full 14 minutes, knowing how little muscle tone I have in my 
arms. Even though nothing particularly hurt at the time (other than 
the usual aching of muscles being used), it's kind of like getting a 
sunburn: feels ok at the time, but if you have any sense you know 
you will pay for it later if you don't get out of the sun. So what I 
did was dumb, and believe me, the next time I'm able to try this, I 
will do MUCH less. Maybe start with 5 minutes or so. And I'm going 
to wait till my arms are back to normal. I'll try the epsom salts 
tonight (suggested by Richard) - wish me luck. My right arm and back 
are not too bad any more, it's just the left arm with the swelling 
and stiffness. ugh!

Your website does a good job of encouraging a gradual and careful 
start, but maybe a big red note would be helpful for clueless people 
like me, saying IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO WORKING YOUR ARMS, DON'T 
START WITH 14 MINUTES. ;) Anyway, I do not in any way blame you or 
your site for this. Common sense would have told me to start with 
less, but I've never had much of that. Live &amp; learn!

thanks again,
Ariel

&gt; Hi Ariel,
&gt; 
&gt; I was inventing the thing as I started, so it was a
&gt; gradual, erratic process. I hadn't thought of the 14
&gt; minute part on day 1. I hadn't thought of the every N
&gt; day part on day one. I hadn't thought of three
&gt; quarters of my moves on day one. It took a few weeks
&gt; before shovelglove became recognizably what it is.
&gt; Since I had no idea that this, unlike every other
&gt; exercise routine I'd ever done, would be something I'd
&gt; stick with for years, I didn't keep very precise
&gt; notes. So unfortunately I can't really answer your
&gt; question, except to say &quot;I started very gradually&quot;
&gt; (though that wasn't completely intentional, and I
&gt; can't give a precise pattern for others to repeat).
&gt; 
&gt; Whenever I introduce a new move (it's been a while
&gt; now) I do feel it the next day. But I don't think
&gt; I've even had quite the soreness you describe. I'm
&gt; sorry to hear it! One important step I took that may
&gt; have helped avoid this: if anything ever hurt, I
&gt; stopped immediately, and took the next day off. This
&gt; didn't happen a lot, and it hasn't for ages now, but
&gt; it did occassionally towards the beginning and it's a
&gt; policy that I suspect may have spared me a lot of
&gt; grief. I strongly encourage you to consider it, too.
&gt; This is described on the home page, but maybe I'll
&gt; emphasize it a bit more. Please do take it easy until
&gt; you're feeling completely well, and then maybe go less
&gt; intensely until you're really comfortable doing the
&gt; movements (and the day after). I think every N day is
&gt; good habit wise, but by all means give yourself more
&gt; space if you need it. Also keep in mind that every day
&gt; doesn't have to be equally intense. The habit part is
&gt; satisfied even if you just stand there sort of holding
&gt; the thing for 14 minutes on a particularly lazy/sore
&gt; day. Keep us posted.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes for a speedy recovery,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

&gt; Deb,
&gt; Flu!? You musta been eatin too much fresh fruit!
&gt; Seriously i hope you feel better..
....Thanks Richard, I am taking it easy and resting and on the 
mend :) You know I was thinking &quot;hmmm, I wonder if I should have 
had five pounds of dried apricots&quot;, well fruit, flu whatever it was 

it had me shivering under my covers for at least a full day...

However we are on on the SG middle path (yes..I'm paraphrasing 
Buddhist lore)
...The tao of shovelglove! The Tao says, don't go against the 
forces of nature, so I didn't! But I was okay for SG on Friday :)

neither self-destruction nor self-aggrandizement (is that a real 
word?!) 
....Is that like simonizing or something? LOL :)

I'm luck i seldom get sick..knock on Formica...I also take
&gt; echinacea twice a day too.
....Lucky shnucky! Your exercise plays a crucial role in your 
health. It directly influences your Tcell production and general 
immune function. Remember to take breaks with the echinacea every 
month or so, for a few weeks at at time, or something like that...

&gt;Get some rest Deb drink lots of fluids and avoid Chinese politics 
and Lithuanian music. Richard
....Okay! No problem...We are watching &quot;It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad 
World&quot; now on PBS...Sid Caesar, Dick Shawn, Ethel Merman, Milton 
Berle...Hillarious! and no Lithuanian Choirs :)
Ancient Taoist Proverb
What is the most essential part of a Shovelglove?
The empty space it swings through....
Okay it's not as good as the one about the empty space in a cup, but 
I tried!
Shieh Shieh :)
Deb Tao

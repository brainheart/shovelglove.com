Dee, Renee,

I'm impressed with both of your ingenuity, and as long
as the weights aren't lethal, I guess it's ok, though
you may want to consider a more stable, single piece
hand tool (doesn't even have to be a sledgehammer),
even if it takes more than one over the course of your
exercising life.

I wouldn't obsess too much about going up little
increments of weight. You can get a wide range of
workout from a single weight, just by upping the reps
and the speed as you get more comfortable. There's a
danger with upping the weights all the time that
you're always rapidly promoting yourself to the level
where it's upleasantly, frustratingly hard. Not only
do your movements become jerky and dangerous, but the
routine is no longer fun. Sticking with a single
weight for a long time also probably better models the
way actually physical work happens. The farmer doesn't
get a bigger plow, he just plows faster as he gets
good at it, etc. I stayed on the 12 pounder for a full
year. It's been over 2, I think, since I started with
the 16 pounder. At some point I'll probably get a 20
pounder, but I'm in no rush. I can't see myself ever
going beyond that.

Is it a waste of money to buy all these fixed weights?
Not if you take it this slow. How much is bally's for
a year, right? Could you save money be buying
adjustable barbells with weights instead? Maybe. But
who hasn't done so already? Is there a basement in
America that doesn't have a stack of these already
lying around? Simplicity is valuable, too. And long
term, I don't see how you're going to going to beat a
projected 3 or so $30 investments over the course of a
lifetime.

&gt; my shovelglove is actually a broom stick with ankle
&gt; weights tied to it..and a towel wrapped all over
&gt; them . i never purchased a sledgehammer, but that
&gt; doesnt make me think any less of my shovelglove..
&gt; HAHAHA it s MY shovleglove.. unique and one of a
&gt; kind...!
&gt; and so far the weights didnt fall off.... although
&gt; occasionally they seem a bit loose and i have to
&gt; re-wrap the towel over them... the towel's purpose
&gt; (unlike with the real shovelglove) is simply to keep
&gt; them in place
&gt; good luck with urs and dont get obsessed with the
&gt; idea of increasing the weights.. one step at a time
&gt; love dee (The Lazy Shovelglover)

&gt; Total newbie here, but last night as I went to bed
&gt; thinking about the
&gt; newest discovery I had come across (Shovelglove) - I
&gt; had already
&gt; started thinking about ways to slowly increase
&gt; weight once I get down
&gt; to that point.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a set of ankle/wrist weights. Velcro style. 
&gt; Each sand pouch
&gt; is I think 1/2 pound and you can put up to 2.5
&gt; pounds into each one. 
&gt; I figured when I wanted to add a bit more, I'd just
&gt; wrap it around the
&gt; hammer end like it were an ankle and go from there. 
&gt; Worst case
&gt; scenario, the velcro unsnaps and 2.5lbs of sand in
&gt; plastic and canvas
&gt; bindings slips to the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a thought. Let me know what works best!

I would think that cycling gloves would work, or bicycle handlebar 
tape.

My fiberglass handle has dimples which really increase the grip. :0)

&gt; Hey All :)
&gt; Sweat is the precious fluid we all emit (at least I do!)
&gt; when working out,,I'm sure my weight is playing a big role in this 

&gt; these days, but from those &quot;Is it in you?&quot; sports drink 

commercials, 
&gt; I assume I'm not alone :)
&gt; 
&gt; Take a quiz on sweat
&gt; Q: What part of the body contains the most sweat glands? (ps this 

&gt; question was taken from the New York State Boards for getting a 
&gt; massage license)
&gt; a. the top of the head and face
&gt; b. the underarms
&gt; c. the groin 
&gt; d. the hands and soles of feet
&gt; 
&gt; the answer is letter D.
&gt; 
&gt; I would say that the biggest problem I had yesterday with using SG, 

&gt; (and come to think of it the same thing happened in yoga classes 
&gt; last Spring), was that as soon as I got going, my hands got so 
&gt; sweaty that I was slipping around...When I went to that yoga group 

&gt; we had little fabric straps which we used under our hands when in 

&gt; that Downward facing Dog pose so we wouldn't slide on the mat...
&gt; What do some of you do when SG'ing to help with this problem? I 
&gt; hate the feeling of chalk on my hands, so although I know that many 

&gt; weighlifters use this to absorb the sweat, I won't like it. I tried 

&gt; to rough up the handle with sandpaper yesterday, to get the 
&gt; polyurethane finish off, but I am really concerned that one day I 

&gt; will just go to stoke the oven and have the thing just fly out into 

&gt; space, or worse, on my footsies, which I am very fond of :)
&gt; My younger brother suggested wrapping tennis raquet tape around the 

&gt; whole handle, which seems smart.. Maybe some workman/exercise 
gloves?
&gt; Just fighting to keep the sledge from slipping was 30% of my 
&gt; workout, and I'd rather put that 30% into my reps, not overworking 

&gt; my precious tools, my hands. It also interrupted the flow to have 

to 
&gt; keep wiping off my palms. Maybe I am making a mountain out of a 
&gt; molehill, but I won't rest till this problem gets solved.
&gt; Please guys, help out, and let me know if any of you approve of or 

&gt; have used these props in your sessions :)
&gt; Have a rockin day!
&gt; Debbie

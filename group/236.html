Well I was a little off thinking that Richard wouldn't want my 
attention during exercise (this must be one of Gods jokes, a 
physical law of nature which plants a satellite radar in your kid's 
head, and at the moment you begin either a phone conversation with a 
friend or some meaningful activity,,,there they are, standing there 
and complaining of severe bordom! LOL)

I guess that cold from the previous weeks really hit me bad...Now 
that it's completely resolved my energy is back 100%.

Reinhard, I have to say that in your response to me about one 
handed &quot;hoist the sack&quot; I got my feathers a bit ruffled and when I 

started working out today &quot;heavier is not better&quot; kept reverberating 

in the chambers of my ego...The Gauntlet was thrown down mister! :)
I did several one handed &quot;hoists&quot; with a two handed starting 

position and then I only went to about 75% of elbow flexion instead 
of taking it to the end of the stretch. I also don't use the full 
length of the handle because I would rather have more control and 
there is less overall pull that way...Starting from the end of the 
range of motion put me at a big disadvantage because, unlike the 
Delts which have Supraspinatus as a booster rocket, the Triceps in 
this position don't really have anything to get the motion 
started...I am so excited because I have very Jewish Grandma Flabby 
Bags where my triceps *should* be, and now I may have a fighting 
chance of challenging these neglected muscles...Other than doing a 
massage backwards with my hands behind my back, I couldn't see how 
I'd ever get them toned through my work...I have *no problem* with 
my forearms, which are commonly well developed though massage, and 
hands, as well as my pecs...
I had fun guys...I'm on track again and happy about it.
I also did a reverse butter churn, which I dubbed &quot;scratch the ass&quot; 

because the handle inevitably rests between the &quot;cheeks&quot; LOL
After one or two reps, frankly, I felt too embarrast to do any more! 
LOL.
Peace and Love
Debbie

Ariel,If you've a bathtub istead of a shower at your place get some 
Epsom salts, they are pretty cheap i sparred alot when i was younger 
and i swear by epsom salt to relieve soreness.

....Let the sparring begin!
Hey Richard, I wonder what makes them work? I think the main 
ingredient in Epsom Salt is Magnesium...
Well, I do know that the correct balance of calcium, potassium and 
magnesium are crucial to proper muscle contraction and relaxation... 
and without the right balance one can get loads of cramps...
I will suggest to you Ariel and of course everyone else that you 
take a suppliment which provides you with the right amount..
It's possible that the epsom salts are getting in through osmosis?
I'm gonna look that up soon. Whenever I do any exercise I always 
have some source of potassium... a bite or two of banana will do the 
trick... If the soreness goes away within a day or two, then it's 
just good ol exercise doing the job and a good sign Ariel...
If you are getting strong cramping, a very different sensation, 
which is very sharp and really more uncomfortable, then it's 
possible you don't have enough dietary calcium and potassium...
I drink two glasses of Emergen-C every day for the potassium and 
vitamins... Tastes like unsweetend Gatorade and the main thing we 
lose during sweating is sodium and potassium... I hope this helps :)
Have a good one all!
Love
Deb

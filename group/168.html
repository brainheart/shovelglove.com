&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt; 
&gt; I've never had a problem with this, not sure why, I
&gt; sweat alright. Maybe it's just my fearsome grip?
D...Fearsome grip, that is priceless! :)

&gt; In the meantime, I'd just focus on making sure you're
&gt; doing the movements in a slow and controlled manner.
&gt; If your not going a hundred miles per hour things are
&gt; less likely to go flying.

D...I agree, and trust me, I am the slowest slowpoke around these 
days, you couldn't *pay* me do anything at 100mph...As a very fat 
blues singer put it in a song
&quot;I'm built for comfort not for speed&quot; LOL
Maybe I'll turn it up in a few months, or years :)
Since I spent took off all the polyurethane sealant off the handle 
it is staying right where it's supposed to. Took 20 minutes of 
sanding :)

&gt; As for the calluses, I always think of that Dickens
&gt; story or wherever it was where the evil overseer can
&gt; tell by looking at the hitherto sheltered hero's hands
&gt; that he'd &quot;never worked a day in his life.&quot; 

D...I love when the leader of a pack of sledgehammering fools uses a 
word like &quot;Hitherto&quot;. It's so incongruent :) 

&gt; Happy to hear it's going well for you,

D...Yes, it is great, I love it! I have even created 2 variations 
and one completely new move to add to your list, if your cats ok 
them...
Check it out.
They are called
1. &quot;Plunge the Toilet Before it Floods&quot;
2. &quot;Jack and Jill Went up the Hill&quot; (aka Fetch the Water)
and, my own special move, geared towards improving balance:
3. &quot;Standing Crane that Cannot Fly&quot;

Sound intriguing?
Thanks for monitoring my SG efforts :)
Love,
Debbie &quot;the Claw of Death&quot; Feder

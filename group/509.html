Thanks for the advice Reinhard! I am currently trying to decide on a 
time of day that will be maintainable. As is the case for so many 
working people, the morning is best in many ways - it's the most 
predictable, consistently available time with a set schedule already 
in place. The only problem with morning is, well, me. I am the 
quintessential non-morning person. I currently get up at 8:20 and 
though it's already difficult, I can imagine pushing it back to 8:00 
in order to do a 14-min. workout. What I can't imagine doing is 
showering in the morning. If shovelglove makes me sweat, as I'm sure 
it will, then I would just have to let the sweat dry and go to work.

My husband thinks I should just do it after I get home from work, 
before dinner. He's probably right. Of course I tend to do errands 
after work a couple nights almost every week, so that would push it 
(and dinner) back a bit. But that would still probably be more 
realistic than morning, even though it isn't conducive to a firmly 
fixed time for working out every day. Anyway, I should stop hyper-
analyzing this and just start trying to do it. I'm planning to do my 
first shovelglove tonight after I get home from work. I will take it 
slow and stop at 14 min. even if I don't get in all the reps. wish 
me luck. 

PS - my Home Depot only had an 8 lb and a 16 lb, nothing in between. 
But that's ok, since 8 is plenty heavy enough for me.

&gt; Hi Ariel,

&gt; I've found the home depots around here have a pretty
&gt; good selection (I always check out the sledges when
&gt; I'm in a hardware store, even if I'm not currently in
&gt; the market). The only one I haven't seen that people
&gt; here have reported using is the 20 pounder.
&gt; 
&gt; My standard one line starting advice for shovelglove
&gt; is: worry less about what you do than carving out the
&gt; time to do it. The stricter and more regular you are,
&gt; the sooner it becomes a habit, the sooner it becomes
&gt; easy. 14 minutes every N day works for me. Choose
&gt; something that fits your schedule but is similarly
&gt; unambiguous.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your kind words about the sites. Hope they
&gt; prove effective as well as entertaining.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

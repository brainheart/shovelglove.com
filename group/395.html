Several
&gt; minutes into it, my shirt fell off of the shovelglove. I had it
&gt; wrapped around a few times and tied the (long) sleeves into knots, 
but
&gt; it worked its way off anyway. How do you guys keep the
&gt; shirt/sweater/whatever fastened on? And is it okay to just not have
&gt; anything wrapped around? It almost seems more trouble than it's worth,
&gt; trying to keep the thing on.

How many pounds is your hammer?

There's no shirt/sweater on mine. In fact, it's still got the label on
it from the hardware store.

I got my own apartment.. I think the ceilings are a little low there
to be Shovelgloving. Except maybe in the kitchen. Either that, or I
can do it outside. The fact that it's about 8 degrees out doesn't
bother me. The fact that my landlady might be watching does. I think
she probably already thinks I'm nuts. My kitchen counters are covered
with raw fruits and vegetables, and I covered my stovetop with a huge
cutting board. (She was in my apartment measuring the bed for sheets..
I have my futon, so I don't sleep in the bed.. it's a furnished
apartment).

Meh. What should she care as long as I pay the rent, don't trash the
place, and am reasonably quiet? :)

Maybe I will start doing the SG and rebounding first thing in the
morning when I wake up.

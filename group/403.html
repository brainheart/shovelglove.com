&gt; Disco eh? Sorry i'll stick w/ the Sex Pistols &quot;God
&gt; Save The Queen&quot; lol

&quot;No future for *YOU*!!!&quot;
LOL :)

Yes it is fairly humiliating to admit that Disco actually serves an 
occasional purpose for me, not all of it but I do like Disco Inferno 
and KC and the Sunshine Band for light dance fun, as uncool as it 
may be! As &quot;music&quot; to listen to, I wouldn't normally listen to it as 

it's way too monotonous rhythmically. It's funny, I spent my entire 
sophmore year in high school living off of the Sex Pistols &quot;Don't 

mind the Bollocks&quot; album... Yes album *not* CD!
Also back then I was, and still am, nuts for the Clash...But Sex 
Pistols were amazing...Ah the 70's! Even spray painted my hair pink 
for a short &quot;rebel&quot; phase! LOLOLOL :)
My musical tastes really run the gamut from Bach to Concert for 
Bangladesh, from Mahvishnu Orchestra to Mahler...And of course my 
favorites... Can you guess who they are from my yahoo name? 
Grateful Deb,,,know who it is yet? LOL :) I am going to take off 
today and pick it up again tomorrow instead... I have a massage to 
do later and I just need to chill a bit... I finally looked at the 
heavy hands stuff out on the web and the metabolic burn is supposed 
to be incredibly high if one does it correctly...Sounds great!
(although it would require that one swings their arms around looking 
like a Bozo, as Reinhard mentions on UR :) LOL

Hey, did you try out my &quot;figure 8&quot; move? If anyone does, let me 

know if it's just me or if it's actually a hard one?
(see Urbanranger from a few days ago for a description)
Have a varied and spicy weekend friend!
Peace,
Deb

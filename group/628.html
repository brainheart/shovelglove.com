&gt; Hi guys. Just wanted to let you know my SGing is still going well. I 

&gt; think I did it 3 or 4 times last week after &quot;graduating&quot; from the 

&gt; broom. It was really starting to feel good, and probably I'm
&gt; imagining this but I was starting to feel stronger by Friday. This 

&gt; isn't possible, right? Anyway, it's fun and that's the good thing!! 


....That is no &quot;small update&quot;! You are doing great Ariel!!!
I'm giving you a new name, Ariel the All Powerful!!!
I am so happy for you :)
Shovelglove is one of the best things I do for myself and I was 
worried that you wouldn't get over that first few days to finally 
enjoy the fun too :)
The body is an awesome machine like no other Ariel. I believe you 
have gotten stronger, so enjoy your great feeling!!!


&gt; PS - Reinhard, thanks for nipping that ugly thread in the bud.
...Amen!
Keep the pact Ariel, I need to get strong again, and thanks for your 
support... I'll probably be back to SG by the end of the week.. I've 
got a bad chest infection but started my medicine today... Usually it 
takes about 3 days for that to work with me...

Rock on Group!
Deb

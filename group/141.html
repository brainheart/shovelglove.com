I feel like I am in the boys locker room!
Without the &quot;fragrance&quot;
From the looks of the previous posts, with the exceptions of some 
people named &quot;MT&quot; and the very mysterious &quot;D&quot;, this group seems 
like 
its all menfolk...That's OK I was the only girl in little league 
when I was nine. I stunk but it was fun to be around all that 
testosterone :)

I bought my sledge today. Tomorrow I will try it on for size :)
12 lb &quot;Collins Axe&quot; brand, made in Lewistown PA, USA
No yellow fiberglass for me thankyou very much. Wood is good.
I am ready to bash up the world
Grrrrrrrrrr! LOL :)
I am very very psyched!

Now where was that old sweater the moths liked so much?
I have already decided on perfect shovelglove music,,,,
Led Zeppelin I...Cranked up to 11 :)

At the hardware store today the guy behind me stepped away from the 
counter when he saw me standing there waiting in line...I think I'm 
enjoying that powerful feeling already
Supergirl Away!

I read the post where Rein talked about going up from 12 to 16, and 
how the fact that the weight is on the end of a stick makes a big 
difference in the force of the pull, well not exactly those words. 
That is really true. When I compared just holding them side by side, 
without swinging them around, it was very noticeable. So I will 
probably just stick with 12 and I am sure it will give me a doozie 
of a workout.
I am starting tomorrow morning. I think I will develop my own 
routine, but, of course it will be 14 mins. Maybe even try to make 
up some new moves :)

I actually LIKE shovelling snow for real, as long as I'm not in a 
hurry or something, but with SG the difference here is the &quot;snow&quot; 

isn't gonna get tossed to the side and I'm going to have to be much 
more careful about not jerking to an abrupt halt, or flinging the 
damn thing through the wall.
This should really help me with self maintence/care for my work, so 
it has an added very useful perk...For those of you who haven't met 
me yet, I am a licensed massage therapist...My forearms are already 
pretty strong, from all that massage, and I know all about body 
mechanics, and leaning in, proper leverage, etc...
Oh and I have already made a safety modification to the shovelling 
motion seen on Mr. E's video sample, which is to grip the far end of 
the handle at the very end &quot;cupping it&quot; so to speak, because this 

helps stabilize the whole thing during the &quot;tossing&quot; phase of the 

movement, and the weight has a counter weight, or force on the end 
of the stick. If this is cheating somewhat, so be it. It's all 
about leverage folks, leverage and balance.

So, arms are pretty strong already, but one thing I really don't 
exercise is my stomach, and low back. And boys (and women if you are 
there, give a holler) let me tell you, when one gives birth to an 
11lb, baby, and have gained as much as I have, going up and down 
repeatedly, over the last 10 years (lowest around 160, highest 215) 
that mid section takes on a very flabby life of it's own...I 
absolutely abhor situps so I really hope that SG helps get rid of 
this kangaroo pouch.
PS I will try to make my future posts here at SG central,less 
lengthy, as it will interfere with my allotted SG time, and just 
give me another bad reason to sit on my ass.
Wish me luck, and good luck to all you shovelling fools :)
Peace and Grunting,
Debbie
If I am not back after 14 minutes send help :)

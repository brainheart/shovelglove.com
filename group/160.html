&gt; &gt; Call me a purist, or just plain picky, but I wouldn't choose to 

buy a fiberglass shell guitar(sorry Ovation), or an axe or a hammer 
made 

funny, you should say that
yea, I am a guitrar player...
once, for a surprise (don't ever pick a guitar for someone... it's 
like (picking a wife) they bought me an ovation

D...&quot;I assume you are either happily single, or miserably married, 

lol!&quot; but I know what you mean, one must bond with their guitar, it 

took me 5 months of searching to find my guitar, and I love it...You 
know, it's rare to fight with your guitar over who should take out 
the garbage :)

&gt; it sucked... kept slipping off my lap all the time

D...&quot;that is HILARIOUS, well I guess great minds think alike! I too, 

actually bought one of my friends extra guitars for $60, an ovation, 
when my Martin was out for repair, but I hated it and it gave me 
shoulder problems. I then pawned it to the guy who was repairing 
mine as a barter for the work... and as you say, it sucked! The only 
good Ovations are the mucho expensive custom ones which have much 
thinner bodies than the original design, otherwise slippage is a 
constant problem&quot;
&gt; finally sold it and got a taylor

D...&quot;Hope you are enjoying it&quot;

&gt; now I actually have a steel guitar, I mean the whole body is steel
it's a National Resophonic, duolian... has a great sound for slide

D...&quot;I think that you are describing a much loved instrument, 
favored by bluegrass folk and Bonnie Raitt,,, the Dobro.&quot;

I think we have gone &quot;off the handle&quot; about these SG handles 
LOL

If you can, and I am guessing you must like Bluegrass if you have a 
Dobro, try to find the recording of the song &quot;You put me on my feet&quot; 

performed by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, with Buck Graves on 
Dobro. It was recorded in the '50's I think, and it's real ol'timey 
and has a great sound from the era of Mountain music, you know like 
O'Brother Where Art Thou, stuff...I love it!
The other guy to know is a Louisana son, Sonny Landreth,,,he just 
plays slide style guitar...He had a great album out around 3 years 
ago which I can't remember the name, but I remeber eating it up :)

Oh Yeah, My back hurts today, right in the Rhomboids area, so I will 
do Shovelglove very carefully next time...See I did write something 
about SG :)

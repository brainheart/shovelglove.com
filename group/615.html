I will try to elaborate more on my chair training.

First let me introduce BURN point.

BURN point: you do a given movement slowly until you feel your 
muscles burning and all you want to do is cease all activity 
immediatly. You may also make noises significating to your entourage 
that you are in great pain. Put some music on, my favorite is 
Sepultura a brazilian hardcore metal band

BURN point is very important, thats is then and only then that the 
chair technique is effective. Or any training for that matter I 
believe.

When you reach the BURN point, be masochistic, go on, start counting, 
every movement that you can accomplish past the BURN point is really 
what its all about, thats when you are pushing your limits. So push. 
Do it until you cant do your movement. And when you get back to the 
same movement try to increment with one more rep. 

Eventually you will reach your limit, the point where you cant do 
that one more rep. Hang in there for as long as it takes, stick to 
your routine, one day you will do that extra rep. The feeling is 
unbeatable. 

Please take notice that im not asking you to do a given number of 
reps or to do the same movement in sets. One set to BURN point is 
enough. The goal is to reach BURN point and stay there for as long as 
you can. When you are burned move on to another movement. 

Im thinking my BURN point technique should also apply to shovelglove 
training, but say a hardcore version of the thing. But it might be 
dangerous with a sledgehammer, sometimes I push past BURN point until 
the chair falls of my hands.

As a side effect you may grow addicted to pain, and antisocial. But 
you will be tough, did you ever want to make one bite of your boss, 
collegues and God knows who else ? Try BURN point

Ok on the chair training movements.

There is some basic movements. All movements are done slowly, until 
BURN point is reached.

Arms, easy, grab the chair from the sides, do curls.

Hips, put the chair down, stand on its side, grab with one arm and 
pull until you are standing right, release. Alternate for each hip 

Abs number 1, put the chair in front of you, sit on your bottom and 
put your feet on top of the chair, then crunch until your elbows touch 

your knees. Very effective. 

Abs number 2. Same technique but you have done abs 1 and want to 
capitalize on it, stay low, dont crunch all the way up but just a 
little bit, just lift your shoulders from the ground. Like all 
exercises, its to be conducted to BURN point. 

For the shoulders, grab the chair from the sides and lift until you 
reach your shoulders height and release. You may also grab it from the 

top but its less easy to control, its a more advanced technique. I 
really enjoy this one, it can be tremendously painful.

Upper torso, put your feet on top of the chair and do push ups.

Legs, it involves some aerobic style exercise, you got to put your 
foot on top of the chair by alternance, like when you do steps but 
with a chair. Makes you burn calories like crazy.

Triceps, you give your back to the chair, kneel down until you can 
grab it with both hands, stand up and pull.


Theses are the basics. Depending on your strenght, if you are trained 
or not, you reach burn point fast or it takes sometime.

Start small, chairs come in varieties of sizes and weights, if the 
chair isnt that heavy you WILL reach BURN point but it takes more 
reps. Use different chairs for different exercises. And do not 
hesitate to have a typology of the chairs in your house, those you 
want to use for a long work out, or for a short intensive one. Those 
whose weight is ok for your triceps or those who will be ok for you 
arms etc.

My chairs are made of forged iron, I never asked myself how much they 
weight nor do I care, my goal is reaching BURN point and hanging there 

until my muscles are about to burst.

I have a set up like so, In front is a large mirror, important when 
training, so I can hate on the weak guy in front of me and shout at 
him to do one more rep you little ********* . From where im standing I 

can also see the tv, which is fine before reaching BURN point, only 
then do I need the mirror. My chairs, have those little gum things on 
the feets so they dont make noise if I have to drop them.

I also have a bottle of apple juice standing by that I only allow 
myself to indulge when I have successfully overcome a particular BURN 
point stage. 

Thats all for now, 

Regards.

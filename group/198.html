 You might want to force yourself to go a month longer or so at the 
current weight just as an exercise in stickwithitude. Make the
&gt; upgrade a reward, not an obligation.

Hi Kai, also, you might consider 10 lbs instead of 12..that is a 
nice solid amount.
I brought my shovelglove in today at work (and had to reassure my 
client it was not part of her treatment, she laughed at that one :)
I showed it to my partner Robert, the chiropractor, and by the way 
he is a gym going, weight lifting guy who looks like the Supermen of 
Chiro's....Okay, so this guy, in the past has been known to be able 
to bench up to 400, pretty strong...He said &quot;Oh so this is your 
exercise machine?&quot; picked it up, and said &quot;Hey this is HEAVY!&quot;
He then said that all of these exercises are potentially dangerous 
to the low back, which we all, hopefully know...
I agree with Reinhard that the less finageling around with weight 
changes, the more you will put your mind to the very simple and Zen 
practice of 14 minutes, come rain or shine...But if you really feel 
like its a cakewalk,,,hmmmm? 
It's your call.

Peace,
Debbie :)

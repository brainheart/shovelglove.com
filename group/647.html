&gt; any reccomendations as to how heavy a
&gt; sledge-hammer I should buy? I am a fairly fit 22 y/o female, and my
&gt; goal thus far has been to be able to hold my own (beat-up) my
&gt; boyfriend in our play-fights. he started working out about a year 
ago
&gt; and i lost my edge when it came to being able to keep up when we went
&gt; hiking, skiing etc. i'm thinking an 8-10 lb shovelglove ought to do
&gt; it. any other pointers/advice for a beginner?

......Well, thanks to the excellent Mistress Stumptuous, our female 
contingent is growing by leaps and bounds... I love that! And now we 
have *two* Storms in our group... Storm Fox, and &quot;I wan't to beat up 

my boyfriend&quot; Storm....Very worthwhile everyday activity, and loads of 

fun! 
I'd say that an 8 or 10 pounder could do the trick... Just aim for his 

kneecaps and then he won't be able to hike or ski anymore! LOL...
Just kidding! My advice, seriously, is you should take at least 3 to 
5 minutes in the hardware store and see which size and weight feels 
both challenging, but not so hard to lift that you are really 
straining.
I use a twelve pound one, and it has been consistently a nice amount 
of weight... and does the job... I would imagine that if you swing the 

thing around for a good few minutes (don't care about the people 
staring at you from the aisles) you will be able to make a good choice.
Shouldn't be too easy, and of course, not too hard... Sorry if this 
seems &quot;anti advise&quot;... Your body knows best.
Start out conservatively and unless it just comes natural at the get-
go, work your way up to the fourteen minutes... it should only take a 
week at most to develop your grip and get the feel for your SG :)
Welcome and enjoy Shovelglove!
Peace,
Deb

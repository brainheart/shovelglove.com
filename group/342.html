&gt; The phrase &quot;twenty-four seven&quot; intruding

....Ahhh the old sneaky, inappropriate *subconscious* ploy!
(ala Inspector Clousseu :)

&gt; by having a strict numbers based workout, beyond the 14
&gt; minute (and very excellent, workout encouraging, parameter)is
&gt; kindof mental and restrictive....

&gt; But it's not strict. 14 minutes every N day remains
&gt; the only hard parameter. But soft doesn't mean
&gt; imprecise.
....Well you don't look real soft Mr. Abs of Iron :) LOL
Good I'm glad it's not strict... I realize from your response that 
this &quot;default&quot; workout (again very cute infiltration of computerese)
really makes it less of a *mental thing* rather than more of one...
At this point I'm sure your routine it's pretty automatic for you 
and you are probably not even counting...
I was being a bit precocious too by bringing up all that paradox 
crap! LOL... I hope you weren't offended :)
I think of you as my SG Guru, and hence the questions and search for 
clarification on my part...Also, I'm just juvenille!
I was a little concerned that when people look and see your workout, 
then try it out, find it might be hard to do, as it is for me, they 
might just say &quot;this is impossible&quot; and just give up... That it 

might feel more like work rather than fun... and as you said in the 
past, it shouldn't feel like a grind, and it should be &quot;enjoyable&quot; 
:)

A few years back some guy was commenting to me, while I was doing 
some tricep stretch/exercises (wow that is really my bad spot) and 
counting all the while, that it's better to do an exercise routine 
based on your sensations in your body...rather than stand there and 
count...The idea, which I believe is true, is that your body knows 
how much to do of any given exercise, and this is a way of avoiding 
possible injuries from overdoing it.... So I guess that *that* 
conversation sneakilly slipped its way into my consciousness and 
into my letter... When I do any type of exercise my main emphasis is 
on paying attention to my body mechanics and just plain old &quot;being 

present&quot;... I was thinking that if one only pays attention to 
counting numbers, they are possibly not being aware of other things 
and being &quot;present&quot; in their bodies... I'm not sure if this is 

clear, but I hope it is... It's all part of that Zen awareness which 
permeates my massage practice (at least on a good day).

&gt; I'm going to do *something* every N day,
&gt; and I don't want it to *require* a whole lot of
&gt; decision making. 
....that's a good point and I understand *now* why you like to have 
a routine... It's part of your whole &quot;habit&quot; philosophy :)

&gt;Having a default doesn't prevent me from being original on a given 

morning, it just makes it optional.
....If you are anything Rein, it is definitely original and very 
creative... A pleasure! I wasn't in any way, insinuating that you 
weren't..After all who but a very original person would create a 
workout device that is both functional *and* fuzzy and warm, all at 
once :)! Shovelglove is the best... I'm hooked on it :)
Infact, I am going to take a before and after picture of myself real 
soon, and then in, maybe about 5 or 6 months from now, to show how 
much 14 minutes a day it is toning and helping me :) I guess it will 
also serve as a testament to NoS :)
But if anyone of you guys says anything about the before picture, I 
will die of embarrasment :) I'm alot flabbier than Reinhard was 
when he started out... You know, the stereotypical &quot;flabby grandma&quot; 

type arms and the post pregnancy waistline, which incase any of you 
SG'ers who don't check NoS group, don't know yet, is gradually going 
down in size.. Total inches lost combined with NoS involvement went 
from 40.5&quot; on 09/03 to 37.5&quot; as of 12/16! :)
So thanks for humoring me as usual Reinhard.... It's all just 
chewing the fat, and felt like picking your high IQ brain :)
(I'm sure you can tell that my college professors must have loved me 
for that quality! LOL)
Think, think, think, think...LOL
To be honest, I believe that, other than the occasional time I 
devote to meditation exercises, my SG time is when I am least 
cerebral and enjoy just being alive..So you have my eternal thanks!
Love,
Deb
PS... It would be fun to hear other peoples workouts too... Welcome 
Richard, are you new? I like traditional names, my son is named 
Richard too :)
Anyone else have anything to contribute lately?
Best wishes to all the SG'ers of the world.. We are an elite force :)
LOL

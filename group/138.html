The 10lb one from Wickes was =A319.99 I think. THe 12lb - with the fibregl=
ass handle - was over =A330. Expensive, but I was wanting to move up in 
wi=
eght and it was all I could find. This was in a very big B&amp;Q. I was 
wantin=
g to try a builders merchant, but they are all shut a t weekends when I am 
=
off work.

B&amp; Q asked if I was going to be driving in fence poles. I said yes....but 
=
didn't mention the butter churning......and definitely didn't mention some 
=
of the scenarios!

Now that's rather bizarre. Before speaking to my bricklayer friend, I
visited my local B&amp;Q looking for sledgehammers &amp; how much they 
would
cost. None there. After asking, they told me to try a Builder's
Merchant (?!!) - which implies they didn't know that the chain would
stock them.

Maybe I'll try the nearest 'Giant' B&amp;Q...and Wickes, of course.

Incidentally, how much did you pay? I may not buy one straight away,
since the 7 pounder is quite enough at the moment!

&gt; Hi there

&gt; I'm in the UK and have recently bought a 10lb and later a 12lb
hammer. Teh 12lb unfortunately has a yellow fibreglass handle - I
prefer wood - but it is good and noticeably heavier. I got the 10lb
from Wickes (DIY place) and the 12lb from B&amp;Q.=20

Ariel,

I use DMSO for pain, read up on it, its available at
most health food stores. Good for soreness, stiffness,
and and alot more, but like i said read up on it and
decide for yourself. Dimethlsulfuroxide (SP)

&gt; Hi Reinhard,
&gt; 
&gt; I really appreciate your concern, but at this point
&gt; there's not much 
&gt; to show a doctor. The swelling is 99% gone and
&gt; there's just a little 
&gt; stiffness left. However, next week my sister who is
&gt; a physical 
&gt; therapist will be in town and I'm going to ask her
&gt; advice on how 
&gt; soon &amp; how much I should start doing SG again. 
&gt; 
&gt; The only other thing I can think of that might be a
&gt; good addition to 
&gt; your site is a mention of tendonitis as a possible
&gt; result of 
&gt; overdoing SG at the beginning. I was thinking I
&gt; might have a mild 
&gt; form of this, but I just looked it up (see article
&gt; here: 
&gt; <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm">http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm</a>)
&gt; and now I'm a bit 
&gt; confused because it doesn't mention swelling as a
&gt; symptom. But it 
&gt; does mention shoveling as a possible cause :)
&gt; Anyway, maybe some 
&gt; sort of blanket statement indicating that too much
&gt; SG can have the 
&gt; same effects as too much shoveling, chopping wood,
&gt; or any other 
&gt; heavy repetitive workout that you're not used to.
&gt; This is totally up 
&gt; to you (it seems like obvious information, but
&gt; people can be pretty 
&gt; dense).
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, have you ever done any sort of stretching
&gt; before doing SG? I'm 
&gt; sure you don't need it now, but I wonder if that
&gt; might be a good way 
&gt; to cut the risk of injury in the first few weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
&gt; Ariel

&gt; &gt; Hi Ariel,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm really sorry to hear this. I've never
&gt; experienced
&gt; &gt; anything like it. Don't fool around, have it
&gt; looked
&gt; &gt; at. Let me know if there are any additional
&gt; warnings
&gt; &gt; you'd like me to splash on the home page.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Best,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Reinhard

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for all the great info Deb! To answer
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; question, there is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no heat or redness (and very little pain now).
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; swelling starts 
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 5 inches below my elbow and continues to
&gt; maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; halfway up my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; upper arm. It's not huge, just noticeably puffy.
&gt; But
&gt; &gt; &gt; it barely hurts 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anymore even when I press on the swollen area.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; muscle is still a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit tight underneath when I try to fully extend
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; &gt; arm, but it's 
&gt; &gt; &gt; improving. The same is true for the right arm
&gt; except
&gt; &gt; &gt; that (a) I can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; extend it fully and (b) no swelling.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it's still weird after Friday I will try to
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; medical attn. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's just so annoying trying to get in with a
&gt; doctor
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't seen 
&gt; &gt; &gt; before...seems like every time I call one,
&gt; either
&gt; &gt; &gt; they're not taking 
&gt; &gt; &gt; new patients or their 1st appt. is at least a
&gt; month
&gt; &gt; &gt; out. I'll go to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a walkin clinic if I have to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks again. You are a big help!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;

my shovelglove is actually a broom stick with ankle weights tied to it..and a towel 
wrapped all over them . i never purchased a sledgehammer, but that doesnt make me 
think any less of my shovelglove.. HAHAHA it s MY shovleglove.. unique and one of a 
kind...!
and so far the weights didnt fall off.... although occasionally they seem a bit loose 
and i have to re-wrap the towel over them... the towel's purpose (unlike with the 
real shovelglove) is simply to keep them in place
good luck with urs and dont get obsessed with the idea of increasing the weights.. 
one step at a time
love dee (The Lazy Shovelglover)

Total newbie here, but last night as I went to bed thinking about the
newest discovery I had come across (Shovelglove) - I had already
started thinking about ways to slowly increase weight once I get down
to that point.

I have a set of ankle/wrist weights. Velcro style. Each sand pouch
is I think 1/2 pound and you can put up to 2.5 pounds into each one. 
I figured when I wanted to add a bit more, I'd just wrap it around the
hammer end like it were an ankle and go from there. Worst case
scenario, the velcro unsnaps and 2.5lbs of sand in plastic and canvas
bindings slips to the floor.

Just a thought. Let me know what works best!

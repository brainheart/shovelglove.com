Hi Deb!! That is very awesome and congrats!! Excuse my feminine 
vanity, but this is the best possible result I can imagine from 
doing SG. Of course I don't need to lose weight on my upper body - 
I'm a classic pear shape so all my fat is in the hips/thighs. 
According to a popular exercise myth, that would mean that SG would 
do me no good since it works the upper body most. But I'm fully 
aware that you don't lose fat from area X by working area X (right 
Deb?). All you can (semi)control is how much fat is lost, and your 
body gets to decide where it comes off. And you lose fat by burning 
calories, regardless of which muscles are used to burn those 
calories.

Anyway, GOOD LUCK on the interview tomorrow! I'll be crossing 
everything for you. :)

&gt; Hi friends :)
&gt; I had a great thing happen the other day, which I felt like 
&gt; sharing...
&gt; I put on a tshirt that, last Fall was very tight on me, both on my 

&gt; chest and arms and tummy...Basically it was really unwearable...
&gt; Well six months later, it fits me very comfortably with extra 
space 
&gt; in my tummy and arms to boot!!! What a great feeling this is!
&gt; Soon enough I'll be looking like you Reinhard (except with a more 

&gt; prominent chest! LOL)
&gt; I am thrilled!!!! Maybe I'll be able to fit into a &quot;happy size&quot; 

by 
&gt; the time it's Summer. I believe I will :)
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I was cleaning my room today, as I'm home.. I quit that job at the 

&gt; lame-o pt office (turns out the Bozo I was having trouble with is 

&gt; actually leaving in 2 weeks! LOL. I found it out when I gave 
notice 
&gt; yesterday...) I'll be going on, what looks like, a more promising 

&gt; position tomorrow so everyone please cross your Shovelgloves for 
me!
&gt; How will I ever be able to get a sixteen pound sledge with no 
money!

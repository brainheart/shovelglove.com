&gt; 
&gt; Sorry about that! The past few weeks have been
&gt; rough. Stress, caffeine, and being super busy. 
&gt; This is probably the best article on the tabata
&gt; method applied to lifting, but I am not into tabata
&gt; at the moment, too scary! 
&gt; As for training, it has suffered a bit with school
&gt; being back in session and myself being truck driver
&gt; pro tem at work, but happily, I am adjusting to all
&gt; of it. I have begun feeding myself better and
&gt; actually sleeping again, and took a week off
&gt; training to recharge. Before that, I had driven my
&gt; mind and body so hard for so long something had to
&gt; give. I am learning more and more that there is
&gt; definitely something to Reinhard's thoughts on happy
&gt; progress versus happy training. I have been doing
&gt; mainly barbell work, and a tiny bit with homemade
&gt; clubs. The 20# sledge is in the closet, waiting... 
&gt; 
&gt; My lovely wife is obsessed with Johnny Cash, and her
&gt; mom gave her a CD of some of his old hits. It
&gt; contains a song called &quot;The Legend of John Henry's
&gt; Hammer,&quot; that is absolutely awesome, and all SGers
&gt; should look it up. The lyrics, although there is
&gt; some wierd punctuation, can be found here:
&gt;
<a href="http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/cash-johnny/legend-of-john-henrys-hammer-779.html">http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/cash-johnny/legend-of-john-henrys-hammer-779.html</a>
&gt; But you should really hear the song, and get it into
&gt; your head. I sing it when I'm driving the truck at
&gt; work, or on the commute to school, and it makes me
&gt; happy. Oh, and especially for Reinhard, I owe you
&gt; thanks for introducing me to the twisted world of
&gt; Der Struwwelpeter. My professor for The Sociology
&gt; of Childhood grew up in Germany, and so was familiar
&gt; with it. He even worked it into the class in a
&gt; presentation on children's stories! Big points, and
&gt; thanks!

&gt; &gt; Hi, all!
&gt; This site is very annoying,
&gt; ....LOL It sure is! Because it isn't here! Send it
&gt; again Storm :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; but it contains articles by Dan John (a VERY good
&gt; thing), including 
&gt; this one on the tabata method.
&gt; 
&gt; .....This is sooooo weird and funny Storm :) You
&gt; haven't posted in a 
&gt; while and I was *just* thinking to myself, before I
&gt; looked at the 
&gt; posts one last time before sleep, &quot;I wonder what
&gt; Storm has to say on 
&gt; the whole workout scene, hmmm he hasn't posted
&gt; lately&quot; and then 
&gt; voila, there you are posting! That's cool! I was
&gt; laughing 
&gt; remembering that thing you said about the typical
&gt; muscleheadz 
&gt; concept that a good workout requires that you &quot;soil
&gt; your pants and 
&gt; bleed out your nostrils&quot;! I'm not surprised that
&gt; you were in the 
&gt; same groove with Richard, knowing about that Tabata
&gt; stuff :) Since 
&gt; you also mentioned liking Kettlebells :) Remember to
&gt; file down those 
&gt; callouses! LOL :)
&gt; 
&gt; How's hoisting feed bags on the farm these days
&gt; Storm? :)
&gt; Hey did you ever post the pics of your competition
&gt; from a while back?
&gt; Busting up any concrete? 
&gt; Are you still swinging a twenty pounder? Is that
&gt; right?
&gt; Peace,

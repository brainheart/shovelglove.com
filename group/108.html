Well, what I like about my program is:

It's in the shovelglove spirit. During the winter, I intend to take
the tire in to my basement. I won't be able to do the big swinging
motions, but I'll modify them to fast chops for a few months.

It costs nothing and is getting me into great shape for the real work
I have to do around the place... digging, pick-axing, breaking up hard
dirt with a digging bar, splitting wood, etc. Yard maintenance is not
a pleasure if you're out of breath after a couple of shovel loads.
Shoveling snow is no fun if you don't trust your heart.

Yet, I have a lot of these things to do, and now I do them instead of
just worrying about them. I can do them for hours now, just more
slowly and deliberately than I exercise.

I stretched my &quot;schedulistically insignificant&quot; period to 19 
minutes
because it's too much fun to stop after 14 minutes. Soon, I may
justify that 29 minutes is also insignificant...

&gt; Welcome to the group, Kevin.
&gt; 
&gt; Whaling on the tire sounds great. I wish I could get
&gt; away with that, but my neighborhood is just a little
&gt; too densely populated.
&gt; 
&gt; This, and the goanimal.com link that Chris posted (I
&gt; need to spend some more time poking around that site,
&gt; looks very interesting), make me think that there must
&gt; be a market for an &quot;obstacle course&quot; type gym, a place
&gt; well stocked with sledgehammers and tires, ropes to
&gt; climb, sand to shovel, buckets to haul, and insurance
&gt; up the wazoo. Sort of like a playground for adults.

&gt; &gt; For the past three weeks I've used shovelglove as
&gt; &gt; the inspiration for
&gt; &gt; my outdoor workout. I have an old tire (not on a
&gt; &gt; rim), a back yard, a
&gt; &gt; 10# sledge hammer, and a 4# setting sledge. You can
&gt; &gt; guess what I do. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, my 20 minute daily workout (which ends too
&gt; &gt; quickly for my
&gt; &gt; taste - this is addicting) consists of the
&gt; &gt; following:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 hindu squats
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 shoveling motion with each arm leading,
&gt; &gt; &quot;shoveling&quot; the tire in a
&gt; &gt; straight line (bump/pushing it)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 sideways swings, each hand on top, driving the
&gt; &gt; tire (kind of like a
&gt; &gt; baseball bat swing, but lower.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 overhead swings, each arm on top, rotating around
&gt; &gt; the tire.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 two handed &quot;ice breaking&quot; swings, each arm on top
&gt; &gt; (like churning
&gt; &gt; butter, but with downward force, not allowing the
&gt; &gt; hammer to rebound
&gt; &gt; off the tire)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 50 one handed &quot;ice breaking&quot; swings, each arm alone.
&gt; &gt; Big time bicep
&gt; &gt; and tricep work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 75 hammer strokes with a 4 pound setting sledge each
&gt; &gt; arm, with the
&gt; &gt; tire standing on end.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's something about beating the heck out of the
&gt; &gt; tire that feels great.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've lost 5 pounds in three weeks and feel great. I
&gt; &gt; break a sweat in
&gt; &gt; minutes and breath hard, but LOVE it. I couldn't
&gt; &gt; have done this in 20
&gt; &gt; minutes at the beginning, but I can now. I could
&gt; &gt; keep this up for 45
&gt; &gt; minutes, but I try to leave before I get tired of
&gt; &gt; it. 20 minutes is it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;

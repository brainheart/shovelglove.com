&gt; I'm very UNcoordinated.. but I'll try it anyway.. I was just 
talking about doing the chopping motions while on there, perhaps.
....Hmmm? Uncoordinated, bouncing, heavy steel implement,,,,
this reeks of future boo boo!
I will pray that you and your sg don't collide where your face meets 
your head (or anywhere else!)

&gt; Well, I did have my first &quot;workout&quot;, and my arms feel like rubber. 

I didn't overdo it. I didn't do 14 minutes either. I didn't do all 
the reps.
....Reinhards workout regime is specially structured for him and his 
body. I just make sure that I do 14 minutes, but if I ever tried to 
do all the reps in that short time, I'd never make it because I am 
much happier going at a comfortable pace :)

&gt;&gt; already had my first end of the handle collision with the ceiling.
.....was that while you were on the trampoline?
Collisions are strongly advised against, especially if your 
upsetting the upstairs neighbors (mother who thinks you are nuts)
But congrats on trying it out for a spin.
I further caution you to, be very careful at the beginning. Once 
your body gets used to the mechanics of holding the thing, then turn 
up the volume and speed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's &quot;Art&quot;, not Al. But thanks, anyway. :)
....Ooops, sorry Art.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They looked at me like I was nuts. I get that 
look alot.

....You sound like you have a good sense of humor!
....Yes when I bought the sledge at my hardware store, I caught 
that &quot;look&quot; from the landscapers and contractors on the line in 

front of me. And yes $40 seems really steep. Mine was $25.
Well, nuts or not, this is a really fun workout, and I aim to do it 
5 times a week, but it usually winds up being 4.
I hope you aren't upset at my efforts to persuade you to think about 
your safety, it's just friendly nudging :)

PS what part of Jersey are you from? The industrialized yuchy part 
or the beautiful woodsy part?
I live on LI, in Great Neck and to my knowledge, you are 
geographically the closest shovelglovver to me of the group.
Peace,
Deb

check in and let you know I did my 3rd pseudo-shovelglove last 
night (with the unweighted broom) and I am switching to the hammer 
tonight. My plan is to go very VERY slow and focus more on my form 
than anything else. The shoveling motion in particular still feels 
very awkward to me and I'd like to make sure I'm finding the 
most &quot;natural&quot; way possible to do it.
.....Hey Ariel :) Grasshopper here!
Don't feel pressured to do all the moves... Just because it's called 
shovelglove, feel free to skip the shovelling one...
I personally don't do it much at all as it doesn't feel right to me 
either... strains my neck too much...
I created a very &quot;wimpy&quot; move back in the beginning that I sometimes 

do when I start to feel I need a little break... It's just lifting 
and lowering the sg straight up and down by pretending it's a bucket 
of water I am putting into a well and then drawing it out... it 
simply helps to keep your grip strong... a bit like running in 
place.. Speaking of form, the more you can &quot;choke up&quot; on the head 

of the hammer the less strain and pull you will feel overall...
Feel free to do &quot;half moves&quot;.... ie less range of motion, not full 

on!
Well as for me yesterday and today I am taking a break, against my 
desire not to, with shovelglove because my whole family has been 
sick for days and it finally got me... Yesterday I had fever nausea 
and chills, and I am completely exhausted... Not too much appetite, 
muscles all ache and I have been coughing like I have TB for days...
Well maybe not that bad, but pretty miserable... Makes you realize 
how much we take health for granted once you get pummelled by a 
microorganism...
I can't wait to get better...
Thanks for your vote of good luck on the job... I am still waiting 
for news on that.
Oh another thing I like to do with SG is squat thrusts with the 
hammer laying right on my spine and resting the head on my arse!
Have fun all :)
Love,
Deb

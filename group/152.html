Hi John, I am in the infancy of shovelglovving, and am, admittedly, 
not a jock, but in theory, I believe that what this sounds like is 
that you may be &quot;locking&quot; your arm and then simultaneously 
abruptly &quot;jerking&quot; the weight-
I suggest that the last 1 inch of extension at the elbow be omitted. 
You will not lock your joint and you won't be putting that possibly 
destructive strain on your tendons by an abrupt stretch at the end.
This is kindof a rule to follow in general, for all movements. Going 
to the very end of your range of motion puts the muscles and the 
joint in a compromised position, and the discomfort you are feeling 
is a sign to monitor and modify so you are comfortable.
Try to do stoke the oven (is that the same one as thrust the spear?)
as if you are only nudging the coals around, not demolishing them :)
If you do hurt yourself, remember the first aid acronym RICE
Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation...
Use your deliberate breath, stoke it a little slower, and maybe a 
bit of hip thrust to make up for the motion rather than only using 
your arm and shoulder...Just stabilizing that weight at the end of 
the stick will do plenty for your biceps and pecs, and pretty much 
the whole shoulder...Lose that last inch at the end and let me know 
if it helps :)
Hope so
I see so many people with injuries in my office, don't make yourself 
one of them!
Peace,

how

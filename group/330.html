&gt; Well, today I did my SG workout.. went well, it does seem to be 
getting a bit easier.. I can really feel it in my arms and abdomen. 

....That's cool! It's funny, but I really never feel it in my abs, 
so I am just going straight to the situps using the weight on my 
chest for resistance... I'm not sure why, but I have a feeling it's 
because I don't like twisting motions much, as I know that torqueing 
(sp?) the spine is pretty risky...so all that oblique movement which 
you are, most likely feeling in the transverse abs, I am 
avoiding...Also, when I was pregnant, my abs got pretty seriously 
stretched (I went up to 250! and I am 5'4&quot;) so I think they can't 

feel anything anymore! LOL :) BTW, Sneezing Weasels sounds like a 
Dead spinoff band! :)

&gt;On Saturday I went for a 4 mile rather fast paced walk (ended up 
doing it in an hour and 6 minutes). I'm still recovering from that.. 
I could really feel THAT in my hips, and feet.

....Hey a real weekend warrior! :)
Have you visited Reinhards other site, www.urbanranger.com ?
You sound really stoked! Have fun Art :)

Okay hammer, time to transform myself from sluggish to 
supersledged :)
(..now where was that coffee?)
It's funny, because the song I like to SG to is a live Dead 
recording which takes up more than 80% of the 14 minutes :)
Oy I'm still sitting here...
alright alright, I'm going now....LOL
Love,
Debbie

I should have taken care of this when I did nosdiet.
Oh well. Done now.

My routine is still pretty much as described in the
last stage of the site. The only difference is I'm now
using the 16 pounder and am actually able to get
through it all with some time left over for freestyle.
I also have a couple of preferred freestyle movements.
The &quot;fireman&quot; which mimics chopping through a door
(&quot;battle axe&quot; might be another good way to imagine
it). And &quot;smash the ceiling&quot; which is sort of like
butter churning in the opposite direction.

My lack of tweaks to the routine (and the site)
doesn't mean lack of observance. If anything, I've
only gotten more religious about doing it over time. I
very rarely miss a (non-s-day) morning. I'm able to do
this because: 

1) I know it doesn't take a lot of time 

2) I know how miserable I feel if I don't do it and
how happy and energized I feel when I do. 

3) I know it's actually kind of fun once I take that
first swing.

4) I make it my top priority every day. Once I'm
sufficiently awake to remember what planet I'm on, I
think &quot;before I leave the house, I'm doing
shovelglove. No excuses.&quot; It might sound crazy when
you think that there are more objectively more
important things (discovering the meaning of life, not
getting fired from work, not being a bastard to people
I care about, etc.) but having a top priority that's
so completely within one's control and easy to achieve
only helps these other bigger but fuzzier ends.

&gt; 
&gt; Whoops.
&gt; 
&gt; How's your training going, Reinhard? Any new
&gt; shovelglove innovations?

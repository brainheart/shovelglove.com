Hi SG'ers around the world :)
(how about referring to ourselves, unofficially, as 
Shuggers for short? Sounds like Shove and Hug in the same name
You know, very Yin Yangish.

I had a much nicer and body friendly workout today. I skipped 
yesterday because every soft tissue in my arms and shoulders were in 
need of that rest period. I had to respect the degree of post 
exercise soreness...Plus I had to massage a very weirdo wacko big 
guy, who as of now will not even get a return phone call from me, 
yesterday at 5 so I had enough on my plate. Weirdo wackos can suck 
out your will to live!

So today I decided that maybe I would be best NOT using Led Zep this 
time, as that on its own tends to send me into an adrenaline filled 
tizzy, and decided to try and be more deliberate and careful not to 
overdo anything. In retrospect I guess I may have been a little too 
caffeinated that first session.

I found some very heavy grit sandpaper and got all the polyurethane 
off the wood and solved my previous slippage problem (which actually 
warmed my hands and arms up a little and probably helped that way 
too, it took at least 20 minutes to get it all off)
I decided to use an old chartreuse and mustard yellow colored hand 
towel that was in the bottom of some closet
(Hey sorry Rein, I only have one sweater and will be needing it 
soon!)and then, after seeing the inspirational photo of Johns SG and 
his cat, I looked around for tape. I opted out on the duct tape, 
because even though it is very functional, it's ugly as hell, and I 
wanted my SG to be asthetically pleasing to me...compulsive as I am 
about visual stuff :)
Found clear 3M packing tape and wrapped it around the folded towel 
ending up with a shovelglove that resembled my grandparents old 
livingroom set in Flatbush that was completely covered in plastic.
Between the look of it, and the squeaky plastic sound the tape 
makes, it brings back very funny memories, and if not for nothing 
will make me laugh when I do my routine (instead of cry!)
But actually, it really did go great, and I am sure I will be able 
to maintain the momentum if I keep at the new pace! I will post and 
describe the new moves in a second sitting, I'm sure they will 
become SG faves and go down in history!
If you have read all of this you must have alot of time on your 
hands :)
Peace,
Deb

Hi Reinhard, I am not a lawyer, and am not litigious, so feel free 
to consult Jacoby &amp; Meyers for your accident law needs... I will 
tell you, however that I have had my own issues of late regarding 
disclaimers and releases....When I do chair massage, sometimes this 
is a concern of whatever company I am trying to gain as a commercial 
venue for advertising my office...No one want's to get sued incase 
some person slips and falls on massage cream after going into a 
state of temporary bliss (actually I just threw in the massage cream 
comment for effect because I don't use creams or oil when doing 
seated chair massage), and especially ( here's the part *they* care 
about), on company property.... I had to draft a release form a 
while back, and ran it by my friend/partner Robert the chiropractor, 
to get his opinion....He's not a lawyer either but has loads of 
experience and has had to go to court for certain cases of whiplash, 
insurance stuff, you know...It was his opinion, that whatever a 
person signs as a waiver of resposibility, wouldn't hold up in court 
if someone really, truly wants to sue...So all I could suggest for 
you is that you keep you frivolous attitude and humorous approach, 
and at worst case scenario, if someone does sue you, you can say, in 
your defense, that your site is purely for comic entertainment and 
then you can fling a sledgehammer at them and their lawyer :)
I liked your disclaimer....And I am sure that you will get some 
doctors approval of Shovelglove. Maybe a Viking doctor somewhere, 
or possibly Dr. Nick Riviera (from the Simpsons)..

Well going back to watch the election progress.
I am very nervous, and on the edge of my seat.
Debbie :)

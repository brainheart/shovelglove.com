&gt; Based on Reinhard's comments, I am concerned about falling into 
the progress trap by upgrading too soon, but going to a 10 instead 
of a 12 would be okay, right? I doubt I'll ever need (or want) a 16, 
so it *is* correct that the 12 is likely to be the end of the road 
for me. Whether that matters regarding where I want to build myself 
to (fit, but not AHHHNOLD buff) is up in the air.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts? Kai

Hi Kai, unless you are under 80 lbs I would generally guess that 10 
will be very doable to you...I think that rapid movements are risky 
so you are correct in being wary of going to fast. Fast usually 
goes hand in hand with &quot;mindless&quot;...It might feel exciting but the 

risk for a strain is much higher, whatever the weight may be...
Use your body &quot;sense&quot; to make the final decision...No one here will 

care at all if you find that at the hardware store, that 10 is 
actually uncomfortable...I say, if you can do a couple of shovels 
and maybe stoke the oven to test it out and you feel you are not 
clutching like the Dickens and holding your breath out of strain, 
that's a good measuring stick...Of course it shouldn't feel like 
nothing....
Have a terrific sg day :)
Deb

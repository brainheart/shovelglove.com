Even pre-9-11, sledgehammers and airplanes just didn't
mix. So what's a shovelglover to do when he flies on
vacation? This was the conundrum I had to face last
week.

Honestly, my plan was just to skip exercise
completely, lie on the beach and relax for 7 days. But
I got antsy. I'm so used to my 14 minutes every
weekday that I had to do something. The economy hotel
we were staying at didn't have much of a gym, so I
didn't really have any props. But I figured the spirit
of shovelglove: imagination, resourcefulness, and
schedualistically insignificant time would be enough.
So for 14 minutes each day, I did whatever exercises I
could think of to perform in the limited confines of
our hotel room, from pushups to situps, to backpack
curls and sack hoists, to the &quot;wall of pain.&quot; Not
nearly as much fun as swinging a sledgehammer, but not
a bad workout. By the end of the 14 minutes I was
pretty winded, and couldn't do a single pushup or
situp more. I think this represents a new zen-like
level of shovelglove mastery: shovelgloveless
shovelglove, shovelglove of the spirit.

Be that as it may, it's nice to be home swinging
actual steel again!

&gt; Hi Deb,
I don't think it's a great idea. 
1. 14 minutes is kind of skimpy regarding cardio as it
is. 7 minutes is nothing.
....Okay, I agree with the cardio point, but I disagree with the 
statement that it's nothing...it still would work the arms and keep 
them &quot;primed&quot; so to speak... At the moment, I am still really into 

the 14 minutes a day, but on occasion I get up 10 minutes before my 
son and feel that I could probably utilize part of it for SG to get 
me pumped up a bit for the day... I really love doing it, so 
starting it up isn't such an obstacle for me, and sometimes I feel 
like I'd enjoy a little relaxation exercise just prior to bedtime, 
but am a bit tired already so 14 minutes late feels draggy, but who 
knows, maybe half of it would get enough endorphins in my blood and 
lower my insulin enough that I would be helping both my sleep and my 
fat burning mechanisms... 3 times a week I have been going to a 
ladies gym and doing 30 to 40 minutes of aerobic/cardio based stuff 
so I am looking at SG purely as a means of keeping strong and toning 
up in the arm department...My stomach is too far gone to receive the 
touted benefits you seem to have reaped (of course you are a young 
man who didn't give birth to an 11 lb baby and never had the stomach 
I did, you just had love handles :) I had love truck tires!LOL )
So no matter what I will be doing the 14 minutes on N days and if I 
ever feel like splitting it up, I will try and see whether it 
affects me in a bad way, ie: opting out or feeling it's not helping 
at all... I'll let you know :) Thank you for your thoughts though, 
I appreciate your support! 

&gt; 2. The hardest part is starting. You want two of those
a day instead of one? You've got more willpower than I do!
Reinhard
.....You are sweet :) I highly doubt it though! I will say that 
when I love doing something this much, it is a pleasure I look 
forward to, not a chore :) Do you still alternate with the 12 and 
16 lbs or are you done with the 12? I think you said you were 
giving that one back to your brother? I will stick with the 12 for 
now and I notice that when I need extra &quot;weight&quot; I just change my 

hand position and &quot;choke up&quot; less on the handle, but I am always 

thinking of keeping my spine and neck happy and of course not 
hurting my hands :)
Love,
Deb :)

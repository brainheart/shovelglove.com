&gt; I like the oldtimers' philosophy of doing loads of variety, 
having fun with training, and always keeping health and quality of 
life in mind. Even with all the goofiness, I still like it far 
better than the modern, macho school which holds that you should 
squat and deadlift until blood squirts from your nose, that lifting-
induced hemmoroids are a sign of masculinity, that you've never 
lifted heavy unless you've soiled yourself, and that joint and 
muscle pains are just indicators that you need to start using 
more/better painkillers.

....Ugch! That is truly a revolting set of guidelines to &quot;live&quot; 
by!
I saw a funny Australian film some time ago, which was supposed to 
be a period piece,,, and I remember that all the people in the town 
would come out onto the beach to watch a famous strongman from, I 
think, England, do his morning constitutional &quot;jog&quot; along the 
water.
He would run along the beach with a *large* stone in each hand, and 
holding them above his head as he jogged...could that have been 
Aston?

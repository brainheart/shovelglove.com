Deb,

Flu!? You musta been eatin too much fresh fruit!
Seriously i hope you feel better..theres a big debate
now amongst musclehedz &amp; workout junkies about working
out when your sick some traditionalists say no! Others
say if you don't have a fever go ahead. However we are
on on the SG middle path (yes..I'm paraphrasing
Buddhist lore)neither self-destruction nor
self-aggrandizement (is that a real word?!) I'm luck i
seldom get sick..knock on Formica...I also take
echinacea twice a day too. Get some rest Deb drink
lots of fluids and avoid Chinese politics and
Lithuanian music.

&gt; Hey all you grunting sg wielding orc smiting oven
&gt; stoking guys!
&gt; I have a flu and yesterday I skipped the workout
&gt; because I was 
&gt; really shivering and nauseous... Still somewhat
&gt; crappy now, but not 
&gt; as bad as yesterday.. So yesterday became an S day
&gt; for me, albeit 
&gt; unplanned.. Oh well. I am giving Dr. Engels
&gt; licensed SG 
&gt; practitioner, a note from *me* because I was absent
&gt; from SG school 
&gt; on Thursday... I missed you guys! Who did it
&gt; yesterday? LOL You 
&gt; know, shovelglove!
&gt; Well I'm going to do a very very puny version of my
&gt; 14 minutes today 
&gt; and unless projectile stuff starts flying out of me
&gt; (ewww) I think I 
&gt; can handle it.
&gt; I don't want to atrophy as my muscles really are
&gt; starting to feel 
&gt; more toned.. I measured my arms with a tape measure
&gt; yesterday and 
&gt; they are only six inches smaller in diameter than
&gt; Hulk Hogan, but 
&gt; it's all FAT! LOL I hope to lose some inches by
&gt; keeping the pact 
&gt; sacred! The only thing I wish I had, was someone to
&gt; give me a nice 
&gt; massage after I am done... massaging my own arms,
&gt; for a lack of a 
&gt; better word, is lame! :)
&gt; Have great and powerful SG days today all! 
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
&gt; Mighty SG Warrior!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;

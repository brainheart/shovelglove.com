What up dawgs? :)
So this week I started going to a women's gym similar to the Curves 
chain here in my town of hoity toity surburban Great Neck... The 
owner is a really nice and highly motivated business person and she 
is allowing me to set up my massage chair and charge a little for 
the members to try me out...She is doing me a great favor as this 
will help get me some more recognition in town and I can earn a 
little of extra pocket money... If I stay there and am consistent 
with my hours, people will start to expect me and then come prepared 
with bodies to rub and money to grub (heh heh nice rhyme!)
Actually I'm really not charging my full price because the owner 
isn't asking for anything from me and I want to make it more of 
a &quot;bonus&quot; service for her clients...The best thing is that I am 

getting out of the house and not sitting on my ass at home 12 hours 
a day. And this is really a perk, the owner is letting me use the 
gym as I go with no charge... It's a nice little workout because 
it's only 30 minutes and basically it just keeps my in constant 
motion for the whole time...Here's the &quot;nice compliment&quot; part.
They machines there are all controlled by adjustable hydraulics that 
can increase difficulty or &quot;weight&quot; of the machine. Most of the 

ladies like to keep it on #1 but that is too light for me so I put 
them on 3 or 4, especially the stuff for the upper body... So this 
lady told me &quot;Wow you must be really strong to be working out on 3!&quot;
&quot;heh heh heh&quot;... I mused to myself, feeling very proud of my 

remarkable strength! I had tried this stuff last Summer and I was 
using the #1 setting so, I guess this shovelglove stuff is really 
making a noticeable improvement in my
AWESOME STRENGTH!
Hee hee :)
Okilly dokilly gotta go watch Ned Flanders baptize the Simpson 
children now, and then I will SG soon after :)
PS... Reinhard, I was wondering how it would be to do &quot;halfsies&quot; of 

Shovelglove incase I'm ever feeling like some in the morning and 
some in the evening? Like 7 minutes before I have my shower and 7 
minutes before bedtime? I know that this won't really get my heart 
rate up as much, but it's still strength training and it would still 
fulfill the 14 minutes a day (or would it?) If yes then 
theoretically one could do shovelglove during the commercial times 
of most tv shows, or just sneak it in anytime....
Peace and Love,

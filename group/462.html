Sorry about that! The past few weeks have been rough. Stress, caffeine, and being 
super busy. This is probably the best article on the tabata method applied to 
lifting, but I am not into tabata at the moment, too scary! 
As for training, it has suffered a bit with school being back in session and myself 
being truck driver pro tem at work, but happily, I am adjusting to all of it. I have 
begun feeding myself better and actually sleeping again, and took a week off training 
to recharge. Before that, I had driven my mind and body so hard for so long something 
had to give. I am learning more and more that there is definitely something to 
Reinhard's thoughts on happy progress versus happy training. I have been doing mainly 
barbell work, and a tiny bit with homemade clubs. The 20# sledge is in the closet, 
waiting... 
My lovely wife is obsessed with Johnny Cash, and her mom gave her a CD of some of his 
old hits. It contains a song called &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer,&quot; 
that is absolutely awesome, and all SGers should look it up. The lyrics, although 
there is some wierd punctuation, can be found here:
<a href="http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/cash-johnny/legend-of-john-henrys-hammer-779.html">http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/cash-johnny/legend-of-john-henrys-hammer-779.html</a>
But you should really hear the song, and get it into your head. I sing it when I'm 
driving the truck at work, or on the commute to school, and it makes me happy. Oh, 
and especially for Reinhard, I owe you thanks for introducing me to the twisted world 
of Der Struwwelpeter. My professor for The Sociology of Childhood grew up in Germany, 
and so was familiar with it. He even worked it into the class in a presentation on 
children's stories! Big points, and thanks!

&gt; Hi, all!
This site is very annoying,
....LOL It sure is! Because it isn't here! Send it again Storm :)


but it contains articles by Dan John (a VERY good thing), including 
this one on the tabata method.

.....This is sooooo weird and funny Storm :) You haven't posted in a 
while and I was *just* thinking to myself, before I looked at the 
posts one last time before sleep, &quot;I wonder what Storm has to say on 

the whole workout scene, hmmm he hasn't posted lately&quot; and then 
voila, there you are posting! That's cool! I was laughing 
remembering that thing you said about the typical muscleheadz 
concept that a good workout requires that you &quot;soil your pants and 

bleed out your nostrils&quot;! I'm not surprised that you were in the 
same groove with Richard, knowing about that Tabata stuff :) Since 
you also mentioned liking Kettlebells :) Remember to file down those 
callouses! LOL :)

How's hoisting feed bags on the farm these days Storm? :)
Hey did you ever post the pics of your competition from a while back?
Busting up any concrete? 
Are you still swinging a twenty pounder? Is that right?
Peace,
Deb

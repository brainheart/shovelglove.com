First, some background on myself:
1-I have worked in a feed store for about 5 years, lifting, loading, throwing bags of 
feed, pushing and pulling feed carts, you get the picture.
2-I have always been a fan of old school stuff (sandbags, heavy 1-hand lifting, Steve 
Justa type stuff, etc.)
3-I am training for strongman competitions (yes, that's right, like on ESPN, but with 
much smaller weights, I'm a novice!) and had my arse handed to me in competition.
4-I weigh a solid, athletic 195# (okay, I have a bit of bellyfat, but not 
much)
5-I do lots of heavy core work (135# sidebends, Ab Wheel while standing, hanging leg 
raises, etc).
6-I have decent amounts of experience chopping wood, shovelling, prying, using 16# 
hammers, etc.
7-I am perhaps more than a little crazy (my neighbors will verify with stories of 
tire flipping workouts in the driveway).

Just wanted everyone to know, like Reinhard suggested, the 20# sledge was picked in 
part because family history with it, partly because I have a different background and 
goals than most here, and because 16# is relatively familiar. So, yes, for the vast 
majority of people, an 8# sledge is PLENTY. The idea is not to destroy yourself, but 
to do a bit more than is routine, and something that will have a tonic effect on 
body, mind and soul.

You guys are doing great! Being the masochist that i
am
i've been doing heavy hands walking in addition to SG.
I do SG in the Am before work then when i return from
work i do 15 minutes of heavy hands power walking. Im
keeping journal and we'll see where this leads.
Thanks

&gt; Debbie, you are doing most excellent. I am still on
&gt; track, but haven't shovelgloved yet today. For me
&gt; the hardest part is just starting. I have a kitchen
&gt; timer I set for 14 minutes 30 seconds. I figure I
&gt; use 30 seconds to start the timer and pick up the
&gt; sg. This way I feel that I have done an honorable 14
&gt; minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to keep Swednesdays and one other S day,
&gt; but need to plan it ahead of time and will post the
&gt; days I am doing this. 
&gt; 
&gt; Great work,
&gt; Joe.

&gt; But then I remembered to get medieval on my own ass,
&gt; LOL, and picked 
&gt; up the SG one more time... held it for a few
&gt; moments, felt like an 
&gt; ass for just standing there, and proceeded to get
&gt; moving :)
&gt; But in all honesty I had two, semi demanding
&gt; massages today and was 
&gt; pretty pooped... by about 10 minutes in I almost did
&gt; a &quot;Reinhard&quot; 
&gt; and the handle just grazed the side of my face, so
&gt; that's when I 
&gt; really slowed down to a snails pace...
&gt; Not interested in &quot;poking out my eye&quot; (sounds of
&gt; mothers nudgy voice 
&gt; effects)
&gt; Tired guys... tomorrow will be shovelglove break,
&gt; and since I have 
&gt; two more massages scheduled on Saturday, I will
&gt; resume on Sunday...
&gt; Kevin...when you do squat thrusts you can put the sg
&gt; on your, for a 
&gt; better word, butt and lay the handle along your
&gt; spine...then you 
&gt; hold it in place at neck level so it doesn't slide
&gt; off...
&gt; It serves as both a level for your back, and extra
&gt; added resistance 
&gt; for your legs.... :)
&gt; Good night
&gt; Deb

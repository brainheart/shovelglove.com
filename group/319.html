&gt; You can also put leverage on your side by holding the handle 
farther away from the head. This can make Flip the Lever in 
particular very hard.

Hi Vaguedude :) How's Canada? :)
.....Wouldn't that be putting leverage on the sg's side?
Every inch that the weight is removed away from you increases the 
load tremendously...I like to keep things closer into my center :)
I don't like the strain &quot;flip&quot; puts on my low back and neck, so I 

just like to do, modified curls...If it's too hard on me I won't 
keep it up, so I don't really like to make the exercises very hard, 
just challenging enough to feel it, but not so much that it's 
unpleasant...
Also, Art, I am soooo with you about wishing it was Spring already, 
but I'm going to try to enjoy this Winter, as wishing it would end 
only makes it seem longer (and it really hasn't fully begun, LOL )
Have fun with your &quot;heavy hands&quot; :) Are you still getting 
that &quot;look&quot; from your Mother and others? LOL
Peace,
Deb

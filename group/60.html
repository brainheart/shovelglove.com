Hello all
I'm Allan, 38/m in South Texas. I've just signed on
here and with the nos diet group. I came across
Reinhard's diet and the shovelglove site following a
link from a message on a fitness bulletin board. And I
love it! I love the writing style, the explanations,
its all good. 

I especially like the idea of staying upright, off the
floor. It was particularly funny, but hey, it does
make sense. The old school idea of using movements
from real life is the best. 

I tried to come up with something similar awhile back
using dumbbells only, but my idea was to replicate
movements from sword fighting or ancient weapons. It
was easy to come up with ideas, ie slash, stab, swing,
etc, but doing this with a dumbbell wasn't the best
idea. Hand positioning was awkward, stopping the
weight without straining the joints and tendons was
less than fun, too. But the sledgehammer is a great
idea, two hands, easier to manipulate, and still get
all the movements down. 

You actually had me thinking of other old school -
real life things to simulate, like working in the
quarry - carrying the heaviest dumbbells possible
across the room in your hands, curling them and
walking with them, pressing them overhead to hand off
the block to the other workman, etc. 

Sorry to digress. :-) I'll be headed to Home Depot
this afternoon to pick up my sledge - er, shovelglove.


Happy swinging.

&gt; Just remember which weekend day you've traded it

.....Nunday, a day for nuns to shovelglove.
It's approved by the vatican :) (okay you all can groan now!)

&gt; Frankly, standing around for 14 minutes just holding the
&gt; shovelglove in your hand would be better than nothing,
.....Chances are that if you just hold the sledge for a few moments 
you will feel so stupid doing nothing that it will force you to 
start your workout :) I actually started to do a workout seated in 
my computer chair (shovelglove made me queasy post) but within two 
or three pumping motions I was dragging my flabby butt up and out of 
it's sedentary state...This isn't a chair friendly exercise, you 
need a wide berth and room to move :)


&gt;With this in mind, anyone, no matter how weak, puny, or tired could 

do 5 days a week without worrying about overstraining themselves.
.....The weak and puny shall inherit the world.
This reminds me of a Simpsons when Rainier Wolfcastle (character 
based on Arnold) is posing as an &quot;undercover nerd&quot; and he says &quot;My 

name is Melvin Eugene Punymeyer&quot; and then says &quot;the geeks shall 

inherit the world&quot;...then kills everyone...
Sorry not sg related, but puny related :) LOL I have a couple of 
massages to do today, yay new clients! But the slashes will 
continue, as I am doing my regime later, come hell or high water :)

&gt; Congratulations, Deb on your latest string of shoglo
&gt; slashouts, and best of luck to the whole &quot;pact of
&gt; blood.&quot;
.....Thank you Reinhard! We're dangerous alright. Anyone known to 
break the pact can expect a personal visit from me to receive the 
shovelglove coup de grace.... So no whining! :)!

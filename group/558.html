&gt; I picked up another good 20 pounder at a pawn shop
cheap, several of them deal in tools, just a suggestion for after 
the important bills are paid.

....Did you pawn your pearl handled remingtons Richard? :)
Thanks that's a great idea..the only thing is that gas is so 
expensive these days, and I would wind up paying 20 dollars to drive 
around seeking it out! :)
It would be a fun treasure hunt though.
Actually, there's an elderly lady in my pt office who, when she 
heard that I wanted to buy a heavier sledge, said that she has an 
old one somewhere in her garage... she said I could have it...
I think I'll check with her on Monday or Tuesday and see if she was 
serious! Boy what if it's 20 lbs though!? LOL...

&gt; Also alot of workmen swear by fiberglass sledges...its the 
durability factor. 
.....And I swear by workmen! LOL
I couldn't get around the feeling on my hands of the plastic...
I know it's strong, but I'm not using it to whale on concrete or 
knock down walls, so I'm sure wood will be fine.. I hate most 
synthetic materials... I'm a wood girl that's it.... Same for 
guitars, for example.. Ovation makes these really durable, graphite 
and fiberglass shell guitars... I just don't like them.
Peace!
Deb

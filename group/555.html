Okay, this was a bit of a wild goose chase tonight :)
In anxious anticipation, I felt like trying out a 16 lb one tonight 
and Richard wanted to try out the 8 lb one!
Well we had fun... First had a night out which was lots of fun at 
some chain family restaurant with decadent desserts and lots of 
tiffany lamps and crap all over the walls...
Then we got to Lowes. Lord help me not go and give a whooping to the 
customer service guy on the phone who told me they had 16 lb 
ones...because all they had were 8 lb ones! LOL. We had to drive in 
traffic and smog about 20 minutes to get there for that!
Then we found our way to Home Depot and they did have them, but with 
those fiberglass handles with a rubber sleeve near the head.. Yuck!
Somehow that handle just seems slippery and just feels all wrong to 
me, so I'm going to just order another one from my local 
lumber/hardware store in town here, with a wood handle...
But we spent about 14 minutes trying them all out in the store and 
actually did about 5 good minutes of exercise if you don't count the 
part where we knocked all the axes and mauls and rakes and shovels 
off the wall! (just kidding :)
Seriously, we were doing shovelglove in the aisle of the 
store...Richie tryed the 8, the 4 and the 3 lbs ones and I used the 
16 lb one... Well, I am psyched to get my own, but when we left the 
stores and headed home, I realized that my priorities should be to 
fix my cars exhaust first... That is just too dangerous to put off 
any longer... Those fumes are pretty awful.. But I am definitely 
into the upgrade once the car's fixed up...Let me tell you my hands 
and back were LOVING IT!.... A few couples kept passing us looking 
with total confusion and dismay. It was funny :) At this point for 
me, that eight pound one was like a teaspoon! LOL...I tried to do a 
couple of one handed hoist the sacks, and after about 2 my arm 
said &quot;Going up? I don't think so!&quot; LOL
Well we still had a great time and Richie had his first session of 
Shovelglove... He has already developed a move here at home with my 
12'er... It's more like shovelglove &quot;shuffleboard&quot; :)
He just pushes the thing back and forth like he is pushing a broom! 
LOL.. I'm gonna get him his own soon, he did great.. but he did 
say &quot;My arms are dead!&quot; when we got out to the parking lot :)
Boy I can just imagine how much more of a workout that 4 lbs extra 
is going to give me... I can't wait... Must make more money soon...
Have a great weekend guys!

Now for that guy who works at Lowes.....grrrrrr
LOL
Long live the alliance!
Love,
Deb

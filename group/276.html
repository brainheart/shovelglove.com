&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's a crazy crackpot science theory by a
&gt; well-credentialed but thoroughly mad scientist called
&gt; Rupert Sheldrake called &quot;Morphic Resonance,&quot; which, in
&gt; a nutshell, holds that the laws of nature are not
&gt; fixed and eternal but evolved, that they're more
&gt; &quot;habits&quot; of nature. The more times something is done,
&gt; from crystal formation to the Sunday crossword, the
&gt; easier, more natural it becomes. So maybe your great
&gt; grandfathers years of shoveling have cut a habitual
&gt; groove for you to tap into...

&gt; 
&gt; Warning: this guy *is* crazy. 
&gt; 
...Reinhard :)
I will definitely check this guys writing out...It sounds amusing...
However crazy he may seem, the concept of evolutionary links in our 
bodies and minds, is a very valid one. The body is a storehouse of 
knowledge...past traumas are stored in our tissues, and reprinted 
from one generations dna to the next... Tissue memory is real.
Also, interestingly enough, to me at least, the Liver is the organ 
whose main function is to control the &quot;smooth flow of chi&quot; . During 

exercise that would be it's task...to send blood to whichever body 
part needs it. And the Liver/Gallbladder make up the Wood element, 
in 5 element evaluation...Wood, is all about love of movement and 
activity (ie exercise) But here comes some more, so leave your 
Western precepts behind for another perspective....
It *also* is the residence of our ethereal soul, aka the &quot;Hun&quot; which 

according to traditional chinese medicine, is the &quot;Ancestral Soul&quot;
(there is also the &quot;Po&quot; which is our &quot;corporeal&quot; soul, housed by 
the 
Lungs) I am not surprised at all, if physical exertion and &quot;stored 

body movements&quot; in the tissues, all work together to bring these 
fantasies to reality...They were real once, and the &quot;Hun&quot; remembers 

it!
That other guy may be crazy, but he was on to something!
Debbie :)

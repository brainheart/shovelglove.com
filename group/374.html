When I do squats shovelgloving, I don't touch the hammer at all. I 
pretend I'm picking up the pieces I've mined. I even sometimes take a 
step between squats and pretend to throw non-existent chunks into a 
wheel barrow. Or I pick up the edge of my tire and flip it over as I 
stand.

I believe, and maybe you can add credence or blow away my theory, 
that squats are best done by coming up on your toes when you are in 
the squatted position. It seems to take all the stress off your knees 
(in fact, squats were the cure to my low-level knee pain - they don't 
hurt at all anymore, ever). If you try to keep your heels on the 
floor, they hurt.

With my shoulder problem, I have a hard time holding anything behind 
my back.. can't get my arm into that position comfortably.

For the last few days, I've been doing other activities 
(calethesnics) for my 14 minutes a day. I'll work them both in on 
alternating days. I believe this is still in the spirit of 
shovelgloving, because I'm doing exercises that help me do real life 
things (like get up off the floor).

&gt; But then I remembered to get medieval on my own ass, LOL, and 
picked 
&gt; up the SG one more time... held it for a few moments, felt like an 

&gt; ass for just standing there, and proceeded to get moving :)
&gt; But in all honesty I had two, semi demanding massages today and was 

&gt; pretty pooped... by about 10 minutes in I almost did a &quot;Reinhard&quot; 

&gt; and the handle just grazed the side of my face, so that's when I 
&gt; really slowed down to a snails pace...
&gt; Not interested in &quot;poking out my eye&quot; (sounds of mothers nudgy 

voice 
&gt; effects)
&gt; Tired guys... tomorrow will be shovelglove break, and since I have 

&gt; two more massages scheduled on Saturday, I will resume on Sunday...
&gt; Kevin...when you do squat thrusts you can put the sg on your, for a 

&gt; better word, butt and lay the handle along your spine...then you 
&gt; hold it in place at neck level so it doesn't slide off...
&gt; It serves as both a level for your back, and extra added resistance 

&gt; for your legs.... :)
&gt; Good night
&gt; Deb

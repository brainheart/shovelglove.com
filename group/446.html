Hey guys, last week I was going to the gym and all gung ho! Then my 
son got a cold on Friday and had glands the size of brazil nuts so we 
pretty much stayed in from Friday through Monday...Guess what? 
Between the little lag time, and the fact that I have been making 
calls and searching the want ads for some job, since massage is slow 
going to develop,,,slow I tell you!, I stopped going to the little 
gym.... Okay, I was all stoked to go there four times a week and now 
I'm like &quot;Bleep&quot; it! LOL...So I guess Reinhard, your SG psychology 

of &quot;yo yo gym hopping&quot; is right on target, damn your theory! 
LOL
But thank you from the bottom of my biceps brachialis and the top of 
my teres minor, for thinking this home workout up! I still haven't 
flung the &quot;widower maker&quot; around today yet, because I was up 

*again*!!!! pre 6 am!!! I think I turned into a groundhog or 
something! Well it's still better than Winter, that's for damn sure.
I was shocked at how quickly I fizzled out as far as my motivation to 
go to the gym, simply because I had to &quot;go to&quot; it....Once I'm there 

it's great, but it's the getting going that takes a herculean mental 
effort! That's not to say I won't go back sometime, but there's no 
way I will ever be able to utter the words &quot;well looks like I won't 

be home today so no SG for me&quot; because I live there!!! LOL
Oh well, one task at a time...right? :) So I guess when one is 
having a &quot;motivational crisis&quot; SG is really the perfect answer...It's 

there, you're there, so get going! :) Some more sblog and I'm off 
again,,,
I went to the hardware store, both to see if they would hire me to 
do whatever... they have a lumberyard too and I thought maybe they 
could hire me as a stock person or something, since desperate times 
call for desperate measures, and to see whether they had a 16 lb 
sledge to tinker with and imagine using in my daily routine...No such 
luck... Only went up to 12... When I asked the guy if they had 
anything heavier, I kid you not, his eyes popped out of his head and 
his mouth just hung agape as he said &quot;Heavier???&quot; 
LOL... 
I think tonight I will ice my forearms since they are getting 
pretty &quot;ouchie&quot;...that's a great way to flush out congested muscles...
Anyone else here ever try ice? I like to use it when I take a shower 
so I can 1. Not drip all over the place when the ice melts 2. Do 
contrast bathing and alternate hot shower water with circular ice 
massage... This method is great for refreshing tired muscles...It 
pumps all the crap out....but that first minute or two of ice does 
tend to make you scream like a baby....
Yours,
Debbie &quot;yo-yo&quot; Feder
(richies &quot;ma&quot;)

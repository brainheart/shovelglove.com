Hi Deb,

Be careful! I really don't want to have an injured kid
(or mom!) on my conscience...

Maybe this popular everyday systems amazon link
purchase would be more suitable:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00017IDAQ/ref%3Dnosim/everydaysyste-20/002-6564705-9371215">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00017IDAQ/ref%3Dnosim/everydaysyste-20/002-6564705-9371215</a>

No kidding, it's the number 3 seller, by count:

<a href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/amazon_earnings.cgi">http://www.everydaysystems.com/amazon_earnings.cgi</a>

Note the compelling customer review. On second
thought, might not be so helpful in the injury
department...

&gt; Hey guys! I'm so thrilled about this! I just got a
&gt; request from my 
&gt; son Richard, that he wants me to get him his own
&gt; Shovelglove! I 
&gt; guess an eight pounder will be okay for an almost
&gt; nine year old :)
&gt; I told him you will have to be really careful, and
&gt; he said &quot;I've 
&gt; seen you handle the SG. If I just follow you I will
&gt; be fine...&quot; and 
&gt; he wants to do the workout together with me!(wow I
&gt; guess I'm 
&gt; someones role model! Neato... )
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to have to pray that he develops a
&gt; fearsome grip or I may 
&gt; wind up in the ER! LOL...
&gt; Perhaps I will start wearing protective headgear!..
&gt; No seriously, I am really proud of my special
&gt; guy....
&gt; Tomorrow we are scheduled to shovel the neighbors
&gt; driveway and steps 
&gt; etc.. since he's going away for a week... Richard is
&gt; pretty psyched 
&gt; to get his little piggies on some green! We're
&gt; getting 25 bucks.. 
&gt; Not bad, but I'm getting the lame end of the deal,
&gt; as he's getting 
&gt; 15 and I am getting 10! Lame! LOL :)
&gt; I developed a very very very hard move but can't
&gt; think of good words 
&gt; to describe it right now... Actually I have about 5
&gt; moves in the 
&gt; making...
&gt; I had fun doing Shovelglove Capoeira tonight for a
&gt; few 
&gt; minutes...Next time I'll have to get out some
&gt; Haitian Voodoo music 
&gt; and really complete the scene...
&gt; I've also been forcing myself to try and do a couple
&gt; of situps each 
&gt; session with the weight resting right about in the
&gt; middle of my, for 
&gt; a lack of better word, boobs! LOL...
&gt; Also I'm trying to improve the strength of my spinal
&gt; erectors for a 
&gt; good strong back.. I do this by laying on my stomach
&gt; and very 
&gt; carefully placing the SG on my upper torso and
&gt; holding with one 
&gt; hand, then the other hand stays on the ground for
&gt; stability... Using 
&gt; my breath I lift my shoulders and ribcage up and off
&gt; the ground 
&gt; while at the same time I raise my legs off the
&gt; ground... then as I 
&gt; exhale I lower myself down again... Not an everyday
&gt; action of my 
&gt; cavemen ancestors but I still like it :)
&gt; Hope everyone had an ass kicking day!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

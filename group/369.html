Thank you, Reinhard, for the advice. That makes a lot of sense to think of it in 
those terms.

&gt; Are you doing 5 days a week? What is recommended? Or
&gt; is it a personal planned out thing?

I do 5 days a week (minus holidays). See the nosdiet
site for more on &quot;S-days.&quot;

The important thing is that you never have to think
&quot;am I doing shovelglove today?&quot; Because if you do,
you'll start thinking of excuses not to. You need to
have a clear and simple rule in place up front. The
number of days is less important than the clarity of
the rule defining them. S-days are great for clarity,
and work well for me physically, too. If &quot;Swednesdays&quot;
work better for you as S-days because of your job,
fine. Just remember which weekend day you've traded it
for (naturday,nunday? not quite so catchy the other
way around). 

Does 5 days seem like too much? As I mentioned, the
number of days is less important, but keep in mind, as
Deb reiterated, that the only hard parameter governing
the routine is the 14 minutes. So if you're feeling
tired on an N-day, don't skip the routine, just take
it nice and slow and easy for 14 minutes. Frankly,
standing around for 14 minutes just holding the
shovelglove in your hand would be better than nothing,
at least it would reinforce the inviolability of the
habit. With this in mind, anyone, no matter how weak,
puny, or tired could do 5 days a week without worrying
about overstraining themselves.

Congratulations, Deb on your latest string of shoglo
slashouts, and best of luck to the whole &quot;pact of
blood.&quot;

Reinhard

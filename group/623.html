The more I have been thinking about it the more I felt the need to 
express myself on this issue here. 

Lets state a few self evident things.

Im entitled to my own vision of the world, so is everyone. My vision 
doesnt have to coincide with yours, or to comfort your vision of the 
world, nor do I care if it confronts it. 

There's been so much effort put in putting men in boxes, as to how 
they should think concerning women that its becoming ridiculous. Grow 
up, there's nothing wrong with being a woman. Personally I feel that 
women who label men sexist and whats not are just not happy being 
women and I feel sorry for them.

In my part of the world, as you say, some women would just laugh at 
your face if you start telling them about sexist and blah blah. Dont 
pour your misery on us. 

You have to accept that there's no such thing as mainstream, or you 
have to admit that nazims, facism and all the ism's whose ultimate 
objective was to force the individual into submission, making an ant 
of the human being, derive from a righteous logic. By the way, is it 
just a coincidence that feminism ends with an ism ?

God saves us from self righteous thinkers, who see wrong where there 
is no wrong.

I will consider myself a very happy man if I have 4 wifes. Thank you.
You cant stand that ? makes me smile more broadly.

All of this has nothing to do with shovelglove and training, except 
for the big hammer that some of you tried to swing at me, trying to 
put me in a box and putting a label on that. It aint going to happen.

You could be a green alien for all I care and come back to me with 
more of the same and I wouldnt see the point. Or perhaps the point is 
that either you adhere to western standards and you are ok or you dont 

and you are evil. Let me state for the record that we never heard of a 

kid shooting his comrades in our schools, thats for moral high ground.

Anything else to add...

Hey All :)
Sweat is the precious fluid we all emit (at least I do!)
when working out,,I'm sure my weight is playing a big role in this 
these days, but from those &quot;Is it in you?&quot; sports drink commercials, 

I assume I'm not alone :)

Take a quiz on sweat
Q: What part of the body contains the most sweat glands? (ps this 
question was taken from the New York State Boards for getting a 
massage license)
a. the top of the head and face
b. the underarms
c. the groin 
d. the hands and soles of feet

the answer is letter D.

I would say that the biggest problem I had yesterday with using SG, 
(and come to think of it the same thing happened in yoga classes 
last Spring), was that as soon as I got going, my hands got so 
sweaty that I was slipping around...When I went to that yoga group 
we had little fabric straps which we used under our hands when in 
that Downward facing Dog pose so we wouldn't slide on the mat...
What do some of you do when SG'ing to help with this problem? I 
hate the feeling of chalk on my hands, so although I know that many 
weighlifters use this to absorb the sweat, I won't like it. I tried 
to rough up the handle with sandpaper yesterday, to get the 
polyurethane finish off, but I am really concerned that one day I 
will just go to stoke the oven and have the thing just fly out into 
space, or worse, on my footsies, which I am very fond of :)
My younger brother suggested wrapping tennis raquet tape around the 
whole handle, which seems smart.. Maybe some workman/exercise gloves?
Just fighting to keep the sledge from slipping was 30% of my 
workout, and I'd rather put that 30% into my reps, not overworking 
my precious tools, my hands. It also interrupted the flow to have to 
keep wiping off my palms. Maybe I am making a mountain out of a 
molehill, but I won't rest till this problem gets solved.
Please guys, help out, and let me know if any of you approve of or 
have used these props in your sessions :)
Have a rockin day!
Debbie

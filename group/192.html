Hi Everybody, I wanted to share a move I do in my workout which I 
have entitled
&quot;Standing Crane&quot;
Reinhard has been gracious enough to put my stick figure picture in 
the Photos section of the site here in a folder labled &quot;Moves&quot;.
Keep in mind that this picture was purely for descriptive purposes. 
And as I told our Shovelglove founder, a picture is worth a thousand 
words, but my funny cartoon is probably worth, like fifteen words :)
I don't have a home digital camera for my computer, so you will have 
to just use your imagination on this one! So after you look at the 
picture, here's the description of how to do it:

Position #1, Starting stance
Balance on standing leg and put your Shovelglove on top of the other 
foot...The foot with the sledge should be somewhat flexed and knee 
should be bent so you are hovering a few inches off the floor. Use 
the hand on the same side as the sledge to keep the handle vertical 
and in place...Just place your palm on top, don't actually grip 
it...This just keeps it from swawying and falling off your foot. 
Don't use your arm to lift the weight in step 2...Get comfortable 
with just balancing it that way for a few seconds. Keep the other 
arm up almost at shoulder height, extended away from the body. This 
is purely to balance out the weight. Then take in a nice and 
relaxed &quot;normal&quot; breath...

Position #2
While exhaling, push your outstretched arm down towards the ground, 
and simultaneously you bring your knee straight up to your hip 
level. To do this you must contract your abs and hip flexors, using 
the sledge to provide weighted resistance. Then take in another 
breath and bring your foot and arm back into their starting position.

You can do this fast, med, or slow...It does take a few times to 
coordinate all the movements with the inhale exhale, but when done 
properly, gives a nice lower body workout. NB the only pitfall that 
I can see is slouching to the side, or caving in on one side. So be 
very aware that you keep your spine straight, your tail tucked 
slightly under, so as not to arch the lumbar spine, and get all your 
power from your core and your breath.
I like this exercise because I need a little break from all of the 
upper body driven movements, ie fenceposts, chop wood, etc...
Hope you guys try it out, and hope it works for you :)
Please feel free to send me feedback
(but be kind, I know that picture is ridiculous LOL)
Love,
Debbie

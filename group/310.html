Yeah, many of the old strongmen claimed to have reinvented the wheel. Some=
actually were innovators, however, and it was not uncommon to pursue all-r=
ound athletic skill and strength. Aston went on from building his foundati=
ons with leverage lifting to end up lifting tremendous weights(as far as 
th=
e bent press, only a handful on the face of the earth have bent pressed 
300=
#, in all these decades, I believe fewer than 10 people have done it, Aston=
being one), and, somewhat expectedly, was also a grip master. For a good 
=
bent press description, check out:
<a href="http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Saxon/Weightlifting/wl-03.htm">http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Saxon/Weightlifting/wl-03.htm</a>
Arthur Saxon may still hold the record. At 210#, he regularly did 330-350,=
and his official record was 370! George Jowett claimed Saxon bent pressed=
385 in front of him, but no one is quite sure about that one.=20=20
The Sandowplus site is cool. I like the oldtimers' philosophy of doing 
loa=
ds of variety, having fun with training, and always keeping health and 
qual=
ity of life in mind. Even with all the goofiness, I still like it far bett=
er than the modern, macho school which holds that you should squat and 
dead=
lift until blood squirts from your nose, that lifting-induced hemmoroids 
ar=
e a sign of masculinity, that you've never lifted heavy unless you've soile=
d yourself, and that joint and muscle pains are just indicators that you 
ne=
ed to start using more/better painkillers.

Hi Storm,

This is great and hilarious. Great because this old
time &quot;superman&quot; attributes the majority of the
considerable &quot;success and reputation&quot; he earned as
weight lifter to (essentially) swinging around a
sledgehammer. Hilarious because though what he
describes *is* a (somewhat long shafted) sledgehammer,
he doesn't call it that (&quot;the anti-barbell&quot;) and has
essentially reinvented the wheel. Note to all you &quot;my
shovelglove is bigger than yours&quot; folks: the &quot;physical
superman&quot; was content a 10 pounder. Leverage did the
rest.

I like his invocation of archimedes to explain the
anti-barbell's superior efficiency. If leverage can
move the world, then leverage can make a world to
move. I think I'll have to stick a reference on the
home page.

Thanks!

Reinhard

&gt; Sorry, that's the link to the Edward Aston thinger.=20
&gt; I hope it posts this time. I don't know if I forgot
&gt; to include it or it didn't go.

&gt; This is cool! Check out &quot;Archimedes and the
&gt; Anti-Barbell.&quot; Powerful words of encouragement from
&gt; a man who could put 300# overhead with one hand! I
&gt; thought this would be good for some inspiration.

Hi Richard, Deb,

What's the best link for tabata? I see a bunch of
stuff, but nothing specific enough for me to figure
out how one might incorporate it into shovelglove. As
far as I can tell, &quot;alternate intense anerobic with
intense aerobic in a brief span of time&quot; isn't too far
off what shovelglove already is, except with
shovelglove (at least as I do it, and as far as I'm
aware) there's less distinction between the aerobic
and the anaerobic.

This is mostly idle curiosity speaking... I'm pretty
happy with my routine, both doing it and the results.
And I know how dangerous it is to risk happy doing for
happier results...

As for &quot;heresy,&quot; please. If you're doing anything even
loosely inspired by or related to shovelglove, I'd
love to hear about it here.

&gt; Well one works into tabata protocols gradually, Dr
&gt; Hizumi Tabata dramatically improved the performance
&gt; of
&gt; the Japan Speed skating team for the last winter
&gt; olympics its good for a stationary bike, pushups,
&gt; sprints you name it.

&gt; &gt; &quot;nobody expects the SPANISH INQUISITION!&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;lets say shovelling for example its monstrous.
&gt; &gt; ....I tried this today! Lasted 3 seconds, not a
&gt; &gt; pretty sight!
&gt; &gt; Also, watched that guy on the video with the quads
&gt; &gt; of titanium!
&gt; &gt; Damn! Looks like the energizer bunny! And his
&gt; knees
&gt; &gt; must be 
&gt; &gt; injected with WD40! 
&gt; &gt; I'd get stuck at the bottom and not be able to get
&gt; &gt; up, or ever move 
&gt; &gt; again, if I did that!!! LOL
&gt; &gt; YOU DO THAT??? Egads man!
&gt; &gt; Must feel good after though with all those lovely
&gt; &gt; endorphins bathing 
&gt; &gt; your brain :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will say that SG has certainly improved my
&gt; ability
&gt; &gt; to hold down 
&gt; &gt; bar chords on my Martin :)
&gt; &gt; But sorry Richard....SG Tabata is wayyyy too
&gt; extreme
&gt; &gt; for me for now 
&gt; &gt; at least...I like my shoulder too much and I am a
&gt; &gt; slow poke :)
&gt; &gt; Love,
&gt; &gt; Deb

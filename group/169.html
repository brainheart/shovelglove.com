In real life, the two troublesome motions you describe (chop the tree 
and the fireman), would be done with an axe significantly lighter 
than that 16 pound behemoth you're swinging... And the coal would 
slide right off the shovel in the stoke the stove move.

So taking it easy, in these cases, is still completely manly.

&gt; Hi John,
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Stoke the oven&quot; was a relatively late movement, I'd
&gt; beefed myself up considerably before even starting it,
&gt; so I can't vouch for its beginner-friendliness.
&gt; 
&gt; My basic policy on stuff that hurts, which has served
&gt; me well over that last few years, is:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) if it's not just soreness, take the next day off
&gt; 
&gt; 2) if it persists, stop doing the movement under
&gt; suspicion or cut down the reps. If you're not sure
&gt; which movement is the culprit, experiment until you've
&gt; nailed it. Don't force yourself to persist in a
&gt; painful movement because you like the idea of it. You
&gt; can always come back to it later when you're stronger
&gt; and try again.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result of this policy (or just dumb luck), I've
&gt; never had anything hurt more than a day and rarely
&gt; even that.
&gt; 
&gt; Case in point: I posted a while ago that I'd stopped
&gt; doing &quot;chop the tree&quot; and &quot;the fireman&quot; regularly
&gt; because of real or imagined back strain. I'm doing
&gt; them again now pretty much every day, just fewer reps,
&gt; and nice and slow. Am I stronger now, or just more
&gt; careful? Probably a bit of both.

&gt; &gt; I'm finding that when I am doing a number of the
&gt; &gt; motions I am putting
&gt; &gt; stress on my elbow trying to stop the motion of the
&gt; &gt; SG, especially
&gt; &gt; with actions like Stoke the fire. Anyone have any
&gt; &gt; suggestions on how
&gt; &gt; to deal with this?

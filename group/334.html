Hey all :)
I was a mess this morning and then I got a call to go into the Spa 
for a deep tissue massage... the guy was really nice but his neck 
was so tense that when I went into my neck release work, he was 
basically pinning my arm down with his neck (all involutarilly) for 
about 15 minutes... He could have lifted a car off the ground with 
that neck! Needless to say, I cut shovelglove class today...but I 
went to the park where I like to stroll** and the guys on duty said 
it would be alright for me to steal a couple of split logs for our 
evening fire....These are all cut from big felled trees in the 
park...They said fine, and I walked over to pick up some logs. I 
figured that it would be easier to drive over there but I wanted to 
see how much of a workout I could give my arms for at least a small 
part of the day, though after that massage I only felt like lifting 
a cup of coffee! :)
The logs had to be at least 15 lbs each and I was carrying two under 
each arm...Woodland Rangers Walk? I walked about 150 yards with 
them, and by the time I got to my car I thought I'd knock an 
embolism loose! I was breathing heavy for sure! LOL
But I know, I couldn't have carried that much if I hadn't been 
SG'ing as a primer...Huff puff... 
The logs are now burning cheerily on our happy hearth :)
I'll get back to SG by Sunday, or maybe tomorrow if I don't wake up 
feeling like a zombie.
Peace and Love,
Deb

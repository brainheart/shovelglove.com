&gt; Deb,
Sorry for the long delay on this, but congratulations!
......Herr Hammermeister!
Please! No apology is necessary! LOL :)
Thank you my friend!

&gt; I know you're well aware of this but I've got to say it (if only 
for the benefit of lurkers): do beware the progress trap. I spent a 
full year on 12 pounds, and it's been 2 now I think since I moved to 
16.
.......Well, considering that I have actually been feeling like 12 
is too easy for some moves at this point, I think that's a good 
cue...As I said before, I won't be doing the whole thing with the 16 
lb one.. I want to have 2 so I can have some variety and if I have a 
lower energy day, I'll just stay with 12, but if I feel like 
Superdeb, I will be happy to have the heavier one too... I did 
infact try it out for about 8 minutes in Home Depot, and it felt 
great, not too hard, but just enough more weight to feel challenging 
again... Also, remember, I don't do SG like you, with high rep 
sets.. I usually switch moves quite alot... Sometimes only after 2 
or 3 reps... Half the time I dance around like an idiot pretending I 
am in a chorus line or something! LOL 
&quot;Step two three four, turn two three four, smash two three four!&quot; 

LOL...
That reminds me.. I have to post this good move which is in essence 
like &quot;stepping in place&quot; for times when you want to catch your 

breath but keep moving... I'll post that later! I think it is 
working my transverse abs too since they are starting to feel very 
strong!

&gt; That being said, I have faith in your judgment. You do deserve a 
reward, and if you think the time is right and this is it, enjoy. 
Reinhard
.....Yes trust Mathilda the Hun! This is the right time and 
place... Lets go!!!!!!
Thanks Reinhard :) You are a great man!
Best to all!
Love,
Deb

Well today I was shovelling the, hmmm, maybe 6 or 7 inches of snow 
out there with Richard... It's good work I tell you, but the 
weirdest thought was passing through my head (well maybe not *the* 
weirdest..LOL)
I was actually trying to imagine myself doing *SHOVELGLOVE* to make 
to snow shovelling more fun?!? Whaahhh????
Aren't we supposed to be pretending to do real everyday things to 
make the Shovelglove more &quot;real world&quot;?
Well maybe I just prefer a fake world today? LOL :)

And I was just flippin that snow every which way! LOL..
It's funny how that &quot;throwing off the weight&quot; as you dump the snow, 

kind of &quot;surprises&quot; me each time now! LOL... 
Well my perspective seems to be changing for the better daily! And I 
am enjoying the day to day tasks that just seem so much easier and 
fun since I started here in August...I'm remembering the time I went 
to hammer in a nail and got my medium/large hammer out of the 
toolchest and started to burst out laughing because it felt like one 
of those &quot;Fisher Price&quot; whack the plastic tool table hammers and 

seemed to have &quot;Shrunk&quot; LOL :) Well I'm getting stronger no doubt 

and I am proud of that!

Well I guess I am now officially a sledge addict...
Now I can't wait for all this snow to melt and temps to rise high 
enough to go out and get medieval on that tire :)
Peace and Love,
Deb

Deb,

Sorry for the long delay on this, but congratulations!

I know you're well aware of this but I've got to say
it (if only for the benefit of lurkers): do beware the
progress trap. I spent a full year on 12 pounds, and
it's been 2 now I think since I moved to 16. I know
it's exciting to progress and difficult to throttle
your energies, but it's so fraught with danger, don't
underestimate this. There's no rush. Rushing is very
tempting and very dangerous, both physically and in
terms of morale. &quot;Too slow&quot; may nag at you, but I
don't think it's a problem any human being actually
has (except professional athletes).

That being said, I have faith in your judgment. You do
deserve a reward, and if you think the time is right
and this is it, enjoy.

Reinhard

&gt; Hey Bloods!
&gt; Well I just felt like celebrating with you all
&gt; because tomorrow 
&gt; marks my six month Shovelglove birthday/anniversary
&gt; here :)
&gt; I can truly say, in all honesty, that this group and
&gt; regimen has 
&gt; been a big up for me in my life and has helped me
&gt; feel better about 
&gt; myself than a ton of other accomplishments in the
&gt; past...
&gt; I'm glad I stuck it out and I'm starting to feel and
&gt; see noticeable 
&gt; differences in my body... Mainly my arms of course,
&gt; since I still 
&gt; have yet to figure out how to make a shovelglove
&gt; stirrup system to 
&gt; strap the thing to my stomach and or heinie! But
&gt; even those are 
&gt; shrinking and firming up somewhat... Now my arms
&gt; feel firm and 
&gt; muscular even when I am doing nothing and not
&gt; &quot;making a 
&gt; muscle&quot;...grrrr! :)
&gt; This to me is fantastic! 
&gt; Well I guess another 18 months or so and I will be
&gt; looking 
&gt; like &quot;Herr Hammermeister&quot; (credit to Lokityrus :)
&gt; except with a D cup! :)
&gt; I think as a celebration, tomorrow I will go and
&gt; finally buy my 16 
&gt; pounder.. I've been toying around with a 15 lb
&gt; dumbell at work 
&gt; (borrrrriiiiinnnng! I love levers!)
&gt; and I think I'm ready! I probably shouldn't spend
&gt; the money but I 
&gt; really want to get a more challenging workout and
&gt; congratulate 
&gt; myself..What was that thing you said a few months
&gt; back about 
&gt; upgrading Rein, something like &quot;let it be the reward
&gt; for sticking 
&gt; with it&quot; ? Well I feel I have really done that. And
&gt; it will be fun 
&gt; to have two hammers going at once! Then I can
&gt; alternate.. On days 
&gt; when I feel like a weakling, I'll use my 12 and when
&gt; I'm &quot;superdeb&quot; 
&gt; it'll be too light so I'll have a heavy one too! 
&gt; And then,,,, 
&gt; watchout I may even go to twenty, but that will
&gt; probably be in six 
&gt; years not six months! :)
&gt; I'm even telling people at the pt office... Today
&gt; one of the rehab 
&gt; patients asked &quot;why is it good to work out at
&gt; home&quot;.. I answer &quot;it's 
&gt; non-optional&quot;... then they look at me with a
&gt; &quot;knowing&quot; look which 
&gt; stands for, &quot;That makes sense&quot;... actually, this was
&gt; the first time 
&gt; I ever saw this guy smile! (he usually looks
&gt; miserable as he sits on 
&gt; his exercycle going nowhere and scowling at the
&gt; LED)..... And it's 
&gt; all thanks to 
&gt; Shovelglove!!!
&gt; So lets all give me a big round of applause for my
&gt; SG birthday (but 
&gt; please no paddywagon! LOL )
&gt; You have all been very encouraging and great
&gt; friends!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

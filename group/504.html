&gt; Reinhard, I have not actually started shovelglove yet, but I 
discovered your site yesterday (via a link from www.stumptuous.com) 
and just had to tell you how much I love it - as well as your 
nosdiet site. Your simplicity, creativity and common sense are a 
breath of fresh air in the chaos and insanity of today's 
dieting/fitness culture. You have great ideas. I am very out of 
shape and have never done regular exercise for longer than a few 
months at a time, but I'm hoping shovelglove will change all that. I 
have little confidence in my ability to stick to anything, but with 
this program, at least if you fail miserably, you still have a 
useful tool left over instead of some silly piece of fitness 
equipment that will just gather dust and make you feel guilty every 
time you look at it.

....Hey Ariel! I wanted to welcome you to our group...
I agree with you that Reinhard is really a breath of fresh air!
Truly &quot;Inspirational&quot; :)
Go and check out your hardware store sister... I need some homegirls 
here to keep me company. If you are really out of shape, give 
yourself some time and patience to adjust to using the SG and make 
sure you pick some really great tunes and imagery to utilize..
It just makes things so much more fun that way! I took about three 
months to finally commit to doing SG 5 days a week... but I did work 
up to it slowly, but surely... There were some weeks last year which 
I only had 2 workouts to show for, but this is such a fun exercise 
and it really makes you feel like a million to do it... So don't set 
your sights on &quot;Failing miserably!&quot; okay :)
Meanwhile, instead of having dust collect on the SG, you can use 
it's fuzzy end to dust your counters as you swing all around the 
room.. Some kind of domestic martial art dusting ritual!
Seriously, this Stumptuous lady sounds like a real gas and I am 
happy cool people are starting to know about a very cool activity!
Keep us posted!
Peace and Love,
Deb

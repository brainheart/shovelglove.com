Ok, I have a sledgehammer. Bought at home depot for about $25 (you 
were right on!). It has a bright yellow fiberglass handle, but oh 
well ;) It's an 8 pounder, which I think is going to be plenty 
difficult for me. I did 50 shovel movements right there in the store 
(since no one was in sight) and my arms were shaky at the end...and 
for some time after. Oh well, the people in the worst shape get the 
most rapid progress at the beginning, right? ;)

&gt; .....Well, I say, get one that won't kill you but challenges you 
&gt; still...Unless you demand something of your muscles they just 
won't 
&gt; get much of a workout...It should feel like something good and 
solid 
&gt; but not so heavy that you can't manipulate it... Just fiddle 
around 
&gt; trying them out...
&gt; I have no clue how big or little you are and this is really 
&gt; something very individual...I use my hands and arms alot in my 
work 
&gt; as I am a massage therapist (you should see the look on my clients 

&gt; faces when I tell them I exercise with a sledgehammer at home! 
&gt; Usually I assure them it won't be part of their treatment!) If you 

&gt; feel, when you pick up an eight pounder, that it's not too easy, 
&gt; then get that one... Be prepared for the first one or two workouts 

&gt; to be a bit hard.. it will get much more comfortable fairly 
quickly, 
&gt; but just don't do what I did the first time I SG'd, which was to 
put 
&gt; on LedZepII with a 12 lb one and go ballistic! LOL... Only go half 

&gt; ballistic at the beginning...there's no need for stupidity here (I 

&gt; am stupid enough for all of us as you will come to learn from my 
&gt; posts! LOL)
&gt; Okay, so go forth and prosper at home depot...Expect to pay 
&gt; somewhere in the ballpark of 20 to 25 bucks...
&gt; So Biffity bop to you and let us know how it all goes down girl!
&gt; Deb :)

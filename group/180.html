Don't hurt yourself! Consider starting with something lighter. Maybe
start with cal, and add the ex, ib, and er later.

&gt; I did the following, just to get a feel for shovelgloving:
&gt; Shovellingx10 each side(low &quot;dump&quot;)
&gt; Churning Butterx10 each side
&gt; Pound Fence Postsx10 each side
&gt; Stoke the ovenx10 each side
&gt; 45 degree choppingx10 each side
&gt; Swiss Automatonx10 each side
&gt; Flip the Leverx5 each (lots of choke!)
&gt; I had to walk away from the sledge after each set. My grip is
freaking distroyed worse than I could imagine! I'm not generally the
type to ease into something, I believe this is a case in point. To be
honest, this was not the fast, smooth type thing I imagine most SGers
do. THis was a desperate man clawing at excalibur.

&gt; That's like excalibur or something. Awesome.

&gt; &gt; Today on my lunch break, I visitted the local
&gt; &gt; scrapyard, its just down the street from where I
&gt; &gt; work. While rooting around for materials to make
&gt; &gt; free-standing squat racks, I stumbled across
&gt; &gt; something cool. At first, I thought it was a big
&gt; &gt; clump of, well, who knows what, but it made me
&gt; &gt; curious, and, after getting the gunk off it, I
&gt; &gt; realized it was the head of a retired sledgehammer. 
&gt; &gt; It was big, too, although I wasn't sure how big. As
&gt; &gt; much gunk as I scraped off the sledge, I couldn't
&gt; &gt; read the weight. I guessed it would be worth it,
&gt; &gt; just for having scrounged it. Well, since scrap
&gt; &gt; steel is ten cents per pound, the guy let me have it
&gt; &gt; (I have bought much stuff there before, and we have
&gt; &gt; a good rapport). I cleaned it and weighed it, and,
&gt; &gt; sure enough, it is a full-on 20# sledge! It is now
&gt; &gt; in a nice hickory handle I purchased at work. It is
&gt; &gt; an effing BEAR to handle. This is gonna be fun!

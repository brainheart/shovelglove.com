Hi Ariel,

Glad to hear you're almost back to normal...

I need to look into the tendonitis thing a bit.

I don't stretch, except for yawning at my desk at
work. I feel slightly guilty about this, but that's
the only ill effect I've noticed. I don't want to give
you bad advice, you probably should stretch. But I
don't want to lie either: I don't.

More here:

And here and here and here and here and here:

And probably elsewhere if you poke around the group
archives.

Best,

Reinhard

&gt; Hi Reinhard,
&gt; 
&gt; I really appreciate your concern, but at this point
&gt; there's not much 
&gt; to show a doctor. The swelling is 99% gone and
&gt; there's just a little 
&gt; stiffness left. However, next week my sister who is
&gt; a physical 
&gt; therapist will be in town and I'm going to ask her
&gt; advice on how 
&gt; soon &amp; how much I should start doing SG again. 
&gt; 
&gt; The only other thing I can think of that might be a
&gt; good addition to 
&gt; your site is a mention of tendonitis as a possible
&gt; result of 
&gt; overdoing SG at the beginning. I was thinking I
&gt; might have a mild 
&gt; form of this, but I just looked it up (see article
&gt; here: 
&gt; <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm">http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm</a>)
&gt; and now I'm a bit 
&gt; confused because it doesn't mention swelling as a
&gt; symptom. But it 
&gt; does mention shoveling as a possible cause :)
&gt; Anyway, maybe some 
&gt; sort of blanket statement indicating that too much
&gt; SG can have the 
&gt; same effects as too much shoveling, chopping wood,
&gt; or any other 
&gt; heavy repetitive workout that you're not used to.
&gt; This is totally up 
&gt; to you (it seems like obvious information, but
&gt; people can be pretty 
&gt; dense).
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, have you ever done any sort of stretching
&gt; before doing SG? I'm 
&gt; sure you don't need it now, but I wonder if that
&gt; might be a good way 
&gt; to cut the risk of injury in the first few weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
&gt; Ariel

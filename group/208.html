Gotta admit, the only Zen book I've ever read is the one about
motorcycle maintenance. And, clearly, that doesn't count. I'm sure I
misused the word. My bad.

When you hit the tire, the hammer does rebound up, about six inches or
so if you aren't &quot;pressing&quot; when you strike. I think you will 
find
that there will be much less stress on your elbows, wrists, etc.,
because you are relaxed on the downstroke after your triceps
accelerate the hammer. You just tighten your grip at the bottom of the
stroke and let the hammer settle before you pick it up again (BUM-bum
- that's the sound).

That being said, I think SG is probably more work for the muscles in
your arms, back, etc. I definitely have more burn with 50 SG strokes
than I do with 50 tire strokes. Decellerating the hammer is hard work.
But I'm breathing harder after the tire strokes. Maybe because I'm
moving faster.

&gt; D....Hi Kevin :)
&gt; I think I would like to try this sometime!...Does the tire absorb 

&gt; the shock of hitting it full on? I'm sure there is some rebound too. 

&gt; I guess I'm concerned not to traumatize my wrists or shoulder, since 

&gt; they are my bread and butter and tools of my trade...But I must 
&gt; admit, this sound like alot of fun, maybe a nice way to let off 
&gt; steam. Fill me in on this please. Of course my neighbors will 
&gt; probably raise their eyebrows, but I could always do it in the 
&gt; garage.
&gt; 
&gt; K... Doing real work is another thing again. It's definitely harder 

&gt; to dig a hole than it is to shovelglove. That said, it's much 
&gt; easier to dig a hole now that I've been shovelgloving. It's all the 

&gt; distracting, non-Zen, aspects of digging a real hole (dirt, rocks, 

&gt; roots) that make it harder.
&gt; D...Actually Kevin, digging a hole sounds very Zen to me :) I 
&gt; suggest you run out and buy a copy of the Eastern Philosophy 
&gt; Classic, &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot;, by German Philosopher Eugen 

&gt; Herrigel...I think you might like it. It's only about 100 pages or 

&gt; so. He spent 6 years studying Archery (one of the Zen arts of Japan, 

&gt; along with Flower Arrangement, which his wife took up) with one of 

&gt; the great Masters, and this is his description of learning about 
&gt; achieving a state of Zen through this ritualized sport. I loved it!
&gt; If you dig enough holes and rocks and roots, and keep coming back to 

&gt; the same task over and over, in a very deliberate &quot;digging&quot; ritual 

&gt; you will get to the point where you are no longer struggling with 

&gt; the task, you will experience a level of Zen consciousness, which, 

&gt; paradoxically, is very un &quot;conscious&quot;...But this may take years to 

&gt; do so unless you are *really* into landscaping the same 3 square 
&gt; feet for a long time, it may feel very Non Zen :)
&gt; You are an inspiration!

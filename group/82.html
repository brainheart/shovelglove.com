Allan,

I meant &quot;you read my mind&quot; in the best possible way.
Please, don't worry about it. Your posts are great,
keep them coming.

&gt; Please, feel free to use any of my correspondence or
&gt; descriptions on your site. I feel honored :-) 
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't mean to imply that I had come up with
&gt; something new over what you have already done with
&gt; the
&gt; farming moves. Forgive me if it came across that
&gt; way.
&gt; I was thinking about what chores would be done at
&gt; what
&gt; time and tried to take myself through a day at the
&gt; farm, thats all. I in no way want to usurp credit
&gt; for
&gt; any of your creative ideas, Reinhard. Without you we
&gt; might all still be er, shoveling food in our faces
&gt; all
&gt; day long and watching the tube for those crucial 14
&gt; minutes a day ;-)

&gt; &gt; Thanks again, Allan. I didn't actually get around
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; scenario last week (I figured experimenting with
&gt; &gt; &quot;swiss automaton&quot; was enough novelty for one
&gt; week),
&gt; &gt; but one thing that did occur to me is that the
&gt; &gt; movements I'm currently doing and have published
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the site are all (at least tenuously) farming
&gt; &gt; related,
&gt; &gt; and that this is a kind of scenario. So I don't
&gt; &gt; think
&gt; &gt; what you've posted is a stretch at all. You read
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; mind, in fact. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hope you don't mind if I quote some of your
&gt; choicer
&gt; &gt; descriptions on the movements pages... I love the
&gt; &gt; &quot;hey, it's gotta be done.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to &quot;Lewis and Clark,&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is my latest attempt at scenario based
&gt; &gt; &gt; shovelglove. I don't feel this is as creative as
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; others and some of the moves may be a stretch,
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; here it is anyway.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; NOTE: I couldn't think of any moves to replicate
&gt; &gt; &gt; picking up eggs or milking cows, but then again
&gt; &gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; aren't that strenuous to begin with.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Start the day with &quot;feeding the animals.&quot;
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; done by shoveling to the side, bringing it to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; front, and 'dumping' the food in the trough. Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course
&gt; &gt; &gt; I held the shovelglove head horizontal for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; shoveling movement and then rotated it sideways
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; dump the food. We did this 10x to each side. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Next we &quot;churned butter&quot; 20x. This is already
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the site, no explanation needed (NEN.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Then we &quot;loaded bales.&quot; This is done by
&gt; holding
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; shovelglove horizontally in front of you,
&gt; &gt; squatting
&gt; &gt; &gt; down, with the sg still horizontal, coming up
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'tossing' the bale into the truck / wagon /
&gt; cart.
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; was my intention to do this 20x per side, but
&gt; 10x
&gt; &gt; &gt; each
&gt; &gt; &gt; side in 2 sets is how it turned out. It was
&gt; &gt; quickly
&gt; &gt; &gt; fatiguing. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Then we &quot;pitched hay.&quot; I believe this is more
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; less already described on the site, but what we
&gt; &gt; did
&gt; &gt; &gt; was use a shoveling movement (to scoop the hay)
&gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; raised the shovelglove straight up, as though to
&gt; &gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hay in an overhead loft. 10x each side. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) Then we &quot;shoveled manure.&quot; Hey its got to be
&gt; &gt; done
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;grin&gt;. This was 10x over shoulder, 10x to
&gt; side,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10x to the front, with a grip change and second
&gt; &gt; set
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the left side. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6) And finally we &quot;mended fences.&quot; This was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; combination of 'pole driving,' which we did 10x
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; each side, and a new move I titled &quot;pulling
&gt; wire.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; shovelglove is held at shoulder height, head
&gt; away
&gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; you handle close to the chest. You &quot;pull&quot; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; shovelglove head towards you, then push back out
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeat. Think of the 'shoot the bow' motion,
&gt; &gt; except
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the shovelglove is held horizontally
&gt; instead
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; vertically. This one burned out our arms in
&gt; &gt; nothing
&gt; &gt; &gt; flat. We did only 10x to each side.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I forgot to start the clock when we began, but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; estimate it took about 12-13 minutes to complete
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; scenario. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am working on &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark&quot; next. I'll
&gt; advise
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; soon as we complete it.

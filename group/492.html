&gt; Way to go Deb, Ive read studies where children who are introduced 

to exercise at a young age develop better focus, and discipline. 
Weighted crunches can be very good my advice try for sets of five 
rather than a bunch of high rep sets. Keep rocking.
Richard

....Yes I agree, sets of five are great..Thanks Richard! :)
I am up to two sets so far! LOL :)
So my son is having a &quot;play date&quot;, with his friend now... He wanted 

to show his friend the Shovelglove... So they came in and he picked 
it up and said with a big smile &quot;Doesn't even hurt&quot; with a cool 

delivery... I said &quot;I love this kid!&quot; and gave him a big high 

five! :)
I did contrast bathing for my arms last night... Wow there is 
nothing like ice massage to get the blood flowing, but it is painful 
I say.... Wanna test your pain threshhold guys? Ice your forearms 
and see if you aren't biting your lips and gritting your teeth by a 
few minutes.... Only go as long as it takes to get numb, if you make 
it that long.... then contrast bathe it with nice hot water (not 
scalding be careful, the ice does interfere with your temperature 
perception and you can injure the tissue) but then always end with 
ice. I can't really explain the feeling this causes very well, but 
you will be looking at your arms by the end and wondering if they 
have changed into giant chili peppers they get so red! The feeling 
is like a refreshed and free feeling... I totally recommend this to 
all of you guys! If you try it please let me know how you liked 
it. Remember to use a disposable dixie cup to make the ice, as 
icecubes will be gone within less than a minute and don't really 
cover much surface area...Also, keep the ice moving the whole time, 
don't just let it stay on one spot...use circular movements to 
massage the tight spots and especially the common flexor and 
extensor tendons.....I needed that so bad yesterday as I was letting 
stuff build up for a long time and the cold weather around here is 
really causing everything to feel tight anyway....It helped a lot 
and reduced my pain considerably....And it's pretty much free.. No 
creams or expensive formulas to buy...just ice!
Hope everyone is having a great weekend!
Peace,
Deb

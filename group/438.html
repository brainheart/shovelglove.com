&gt; Thanks Deb for the reply and the e-card!
&gt; Bueller..Ferris Bueller from the movie when Ben Stein
&gt; is taking roll in class. What sort of work do you do
&gt; Deb?
.... I am a massage therapist now, but in past lives I worked as an 
English as a Second Language teacher, substitute teacher in public 
school, various and sundry other crummy jobs and deluxe auto part 
delivery girl! :) I guess that primed me for Shovelglove since I 
was carrying around disc brakes, car batteries, and mufflers! :)
Thank goodness I finally found something I really love doing...
My first degree was in Music though and I still sing and play guitar 
with my little Richard (he is neither Loki nor Tyrus, just Cute-us)

&gt;I worked in Corrections for over 10 years...
....Gee I wonder if you ever ran into one of my last &quot;winner&quot; 

boyfriends who spent 5 years on Rikers Island? Great taste huh? 
LOL :)
then
&gt; i went to school to study Computer Networks now i work
&gt; help desk tech support and fix comps out of my house.
....Good job eh? Better than riot control :)
Now, I can see why you may have chosen to take up Kettlebells and 
SG,,, Self preservation! LOL :)
Hey the worst thing a computer can do to you is get you pissed when 
it has a virus, it's not trying to bust a cap in your ass...Hey did 
you ever see that funny Woody Allen movie &quot;Take the Money and Run?&quot; 

I liked when he made a gun out of soap and shoe polish and then it 
foamed up when he tried to use it on the guards in a rain storm! LOL!
Remember to sleep late tomorrow :)
Deb
PS... I did a great Sg routine tonight and became Mathilda the Hun :)

&gt; Well there are some advatages to my condition!
&gt; When I'm &quot;up and a'tem&quot; it really helps me get the
&gt; superhuman 
&gt; strength I need for a great workout!
&gt; I just did a bunch of awesome stuff :)
&gt; I was swingin that lasso like there's no tomorrow!
&gt; Ride'em Grateful Deb!!! Yeeehaw!
&gt; I've managed to be able to do 10 overhead circles in
&gt; each direction 
&gt; and it's getting real smooth.. Feels like I am
&gt; playing hula hoop!
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I have developed, over the last month or so, a
&gt; hmm not really 
&gt; new move, but well a variation... I love the
&gt; chopping wood stuff, 
&gt; but I really like the Fireman better.. So these are
&gt; the two ways I 
&gt; like to do the Fireman.. first one is, instead of
&gt; breaking the SG as 
&gt; it &quot;breaks down the door&quot;, I just keep making
&gt; continual circular 
&gt; hits with no abrupt &quot;break&quot; motion... just let the
&gt; thing come round 
&gt; full circle and keep it rolling as long as
&gt; possible.. Then switch..
&gt; The other more interesting, and potentially
&gt; dangerous move I like, 
&gt; and this really get the breath moving and the blood
&gt; pumping is 
&gt; Shovelglove &quot;Pitching Baseballs&quot;... This requires
&gt; that you have at 
&gt; least 12 or 13 feet to &quot;Step into the pitch&quot;... Just
&gt; pretend the Sg 
&gt; is a baseball and you are Darryl Strawberry (but
&gt; without the crack 
&gt; cocaine)
&gt; Then after you &quot;Pitch&quot; it, just step back and do it
&gt; again and 
&gt; again...
&gt; NB...DON'T LET GO! LOL :)
&gt; 
&gt; Believe it or not, the forward momentum, as long as
&gt; you are not a 
&gt; complete spazz or too fast, doesn't make this move
&gt; more unstable, it 
&gt; actually helps to step into it...Try these moves
&gt; guys they are 
&gt; awesome! Oh Richard, I still can't get into a third
&gt; round of Tabata 
&gt; with my &quot;Hoists&quot; LOL... I did two sets and breathed
&gt; like hell and 
&gt; then by the third time I was dead!!! LOLOLOL... I am
&gt; sure I will get 
&gt; that down one day :) 
&gt; The SG feels great today guys!
&gt; I think I will be keeping it in my bed like a teddy
&gt; bear tonight!
&gt; I need to think of a name for my trusty ax...
&gt; Mathilda? Nah, too gay... LOL :)
&gt; I'll think of something :)
&gt; Peace all Warriors!
&gt; Rock On!
&gt; Deb
&gt;

Hi friends :)
I had a great thing happen the other day, which I felt like 
sharing...
I put on a tshirt that, last Fall was very tight on me, both on my 
chest and arms and tummy...Basically it was really unwearable...
Well six months later, it fits me very comfortably with extra space 
in my tummy and arms to boot!!! What a great feeling this is!
Soon enough I'll be looking like you Reinhard (except with a more 
prominent chest! LOL)
I am thrilled!!!! Maybe I'll be able to fit into a &quot;happy size&quot; by 

the time it's Summer. I believe I will :)

I wanted to share my Shovelglove music with you all incase you are 
looking for fun stuff to move to... What else would Grateful Deb 
listen to? None other than, you know who :)
If you click on this link, you will be on a &quot;Tapers&quot; site... and the 

sound quality is excellent... The whole shows are there to download, 
but the song I use is &quot;Franklin's Tower&quot;... it runs just about 12 

minutes and has a good upbeat feeling...
I was cleaning my room today, as I'm home.. I quit that job at the 
lame-o pt office (turns out the Bozo I was having trouble with is 
actually leaving in 2 weeks! LOL. I found it out when I gave notice 
yesterday...) I'll be going on, what looks like, a more promising 
position tomorrow so everyone please cross your Shovelgloves for me!
How will I ever be able to get a sixteen pound sledge with no money! 
LOL... Anyway, as soon as this song came on, from my burned mix of 
Dead stuff, I had to stop cleaning and putting away socks (how 
exciting!) and it was just like Reinhard says, on the SG homepage, I 
immediately felt the urge to work out! Pavlov's &quot;Dead&quot; Dog did some 

major sweating today, I tell you! I did a whole lot of freestyle 
and hoists, this time at a 45 degree angle while lunging forward and 
dragging the thing up my back, as opposed to straight up in the 
air... Not to sound too perverted, but, I have to say,,,
Friction makes it harder! LOL....
Have a great day... I wish all you metalheads the best :)
Here's the link to Nugs.net 
and let me know if any of you like the tunes?
Jerry Garcia Lives!
Peace and Rock on Warriors!
Love,
Deb

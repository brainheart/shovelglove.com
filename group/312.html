&gt; Hi Storm,
&gt; This is great and hilarious. 
....Yes, and well written :) Kind of smashes the dumb musclehead 
stereotype..Figures he's British :)

Note to all you &quot;my shovelglove is bigger than yours&quot; folks: 

the &quot;physical superman&quot; was content a 10 pounder. Leverage did 
the
&gt; rest.
....Reinhard, I can't speak for my &quot;arch enemy&quot; (you know who you 

are Mr. Blanc! LOL!) but I will say that all that &quot;SG Strutting&quot; is 

just good fun and kidding :)
If you can get a long enough lever you really can move mountains...
Leverage is a main key to all &quot;movement arts&quot;, it is central to 

correct body mechanics...
Remember the old wartime device, the catapult? Also, in addition to 
his weight lifting regime, note that this superman &quot;took long 
country walks&quot; in search of heavy stones to toss (purposeful 
walking!) and he believed that his Will was an essential force in 
the development of his body...But I don't think he mentioned 
wrapping a sweater around the anti-barbell or any cats in his home..
And how about that great leopard spotted leotard! How about a pose 
like that on your next picture? :) LOL
Peace and Leverage,
Deb

&quot;We are family...&quot; Sister Sledge (lol)
Well Storm, I guess your love of steel is inherited!
I keep thinking what Shovelglove music might be apropriate for you?
Hmmm,
I know! 
&quot;Ironman&quot; by Ozzy :)
It's great that you understand some essentials of body 
mechanics...The major injuries, especially to the low back, are a 
result of lifting something, while torqueing the spine...When you do 
pivot your feet, as you mentioned, so you spine stays in a line, all 
your power is being accessed, from your &quot;core&quot; or as the Japanese 

call it, &quot;Hara&quot; and you are using &quot;The Force&quot;. Always use this as 
a 
rule of thumb, when pushing, pulling, lifting etc...anything, face 
it directly in front of you, not to the side or behind you.
I think it's great that you are so active! An inspiration to be 
sure :)

If you remember also, to tuck your tush under slightly, you know 
tuck your tailbone a bit forward to keep your lumbar area in line 
with your torso...this will keep you from arching your back. One 
last important tip, watch out for &quot;looking down&quot; with your head, 

rather, you glance down with your eyes...This should all help 
maintain proper alignment and reduce the chances of injury...PS. 
There is really no need to be embarrased by an injury, it was a very 
important lesson for you, and no book could ever take the place of 
experience. I spent nine months in unabating pain when I partially 
dislocated some ribs and strained some rotator cuff muscles, while 
in school no less..I was lifting a pretty heavy amplifier to a gig 
and that was the straw that broke the camels back...I had to finish 
3 more semesters of massage school with a very injured shoulder, 
which resulted in full blown Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, and my right 
arm, which is my dominant one, wound up actually atrophying..Thought 
my career was doomed and it was really upsetting, but boy did I 
learn alot that year...In the end I feel I am a much more 
compassionate health care provider and can truly relate to what my 
clients are experiencing.
Sounds like you have your head on straight :)
Have fun with &quot;The Demolisher!&quot;
Deb

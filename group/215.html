Thank you for your thoughtful response, Deb. I'm getting a bit off 
topic here, so this'll be my last post on the subject. It can always 
be taken to e-mail.

I originally hurt my shoulder taking a punch to a pad during Karate 
(the dude doing the punching threw a hard roundhouse after the 
instructor told everyone to stop. I relaxed. Sigh). That was a more 
than a year ago. Mild librum tear, nothing protruding in the joint, 
which is still smooth as a baby's bottom, according to the Doc. But, 
frozen shoulder since November. Negative MRI. And, of course, it 
derailed my progress towards a black belt.

I'm a 45 year old insulin-dependent diabetic: I've learned to roll 
with it. I don't expect a shoulder miracle. I just want it strong 
enough to use it and reasonably free in range so I can shoot hoops 
with my 10 year old (not yet) and bump the volleyball with my 13 year 
old. Then maybe go back for my black belt. 

The SGing seems to be helping - a lot. I always concentrate on not 
going to fast or hard with that shoulder.

I'm still doing gentle range of motion with a pulley. I ice it when 
I'm done. I'm thinking maybe I should heat it before I start.

As long as I see any improvement over time - a long time is okay, I'm 
a happy guy.

Again, thanks for your thoughtful advice. I'll re-read it carefully 
and consider what I should do about massage. I'm in the D.C. area. 
Got any colleagues? :0)

&gt; folks, feel free to skip it if not of personal interest :)
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Kevin :)
&gt; Yes you are right about less pain being a good sign...Have you 
&gt; considered getting a good massage to help resolve whatever trigger 

&gt; points, and tendinitis that may still remain? They usually go hand 

&gt; in hand.
&gt; Passive and PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation)
&gt; stretching with a therapist who is good at Sports type techniques 

is 
&gt; very effective to help you with ROM...But as far as rehabilitation 

&gt; and realistic expectations, don't be surprised if you have 
lingering 
&gt; stuff for up to a whole year...I'm not trying to bum you out, but 

&gt; real injuries have a tendency to cause muscle splinting and usually 

&gt; trigger points develop. We use the shoulder *all* the time and it 

&gt; cant just stay in a sling forever, so it will take some time to 
&gt; really recover and heal, but even after the healing stage, it can 

&gt; have limited function, due to these trigger points. No problem 
&gt; until you go and put the muscle under load (sledgehammers are 
&gt; definitely load) and also if you stretch the compromised muscle it 

&gt; will instigate a pain response...Plus the really sucky thing about 

&gt; trigger points, is that they not only hurt, but can reduce the 
&gt; muscles strength considerably, as I said in a previous post, I am 

&gt; becoming a lefty for some things these days. The constant 
&gt; contraction can cause the whole muscle to have less ROM, you 
mention 
&gt; rotator cuff but consider maybe that you might have hurt the long 

&gt; head of the biceps as well, even though that is technically not 
&gt; a &quot;cuff&quot; muscle, it can get clipped pretty nicely too and hurt alot 

&gt; at the anterior shoulder...I am taking a wild guess and please 
&gt; correct me if I am wrong, but did you hurt either
&gt; A. Supraspinatus or 
&gt; B. Infraspinatus
&gt; these are very commonly hurt because they are small and we use them 

&gt; all of the time which can really fatigue them
&gt; or 
&gt; C...I don't have a clue, LOL
&gt; If your answer is C, it is time to go to a massage therapist who 
&gt; knows how to do muscle length testing, knows how to do Sports 
&gt; massage and can deactivate your trigger points.
&gt; If you lived on Long Island I would encourage you to come to my 
&gt; office, but I guess you will have to find someone up there wherever 

&gt; you are in the World (just make sure they are licensed and good)
&gt; I hope you continue to improve on your health path :)
&gt; When your shoulder really acts up, try to use contrast bathing 
which 
&gt; is 1 or 2 minutes of circular ice massage to the junction where you 

&gt; have the tenderness, then use a warm, not scalding, heat compress, 

&gt; or warm shower water, for about 3 minutes, then go back to the ice 

&gt; for a few minutes...you can do this 3 or 4 times...Always end with 

&gt; ice to reduce tissue fluid loss in the muscle, otherwise you may 
&gt; wind up even *more* sore...This technique brings fresh blood to the 

&gt; area and pumps out the metabolic &quot;crap&quot; that builds up in the 

&gt; tissues...You may scream at first when you use the ice, but it does 

&gt; eventually have an analgesic effect and will be very helpful, 
&gt; especially after working out...I do it whenever my arms feel too 
&gt; full and I have been doing lots of massage, it flushes them and 
they 
&gt; feel really good after. If you already know about any of this, 
&gt; forgive me for assuming you don't...
&gt; Have a nice rainy day, it's pouring down here in NY too :)
&gt; 
&gt; Time to wield the axe!
&gt; Peace and Love
&gt; Debbie

&gt; Hi Deb!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm somewhat better, thanks for asking. 
...Well until last week I was barely working at all, for most of the 
Winter, as it was pretty slow, and I'd only do an occasional massage 
here and there.. Well clearly no one can live on such sporadic work 
so I had to get a supplemental income which would be predictable... 
Hence the &quot;Bozo&quot; comment, as my new boss where I am working now as a 

part time physical therapist aide, is an extreme weenie! It's much 
nicer, but poorer, to work for ones self!
Fortunately, that seems to be picking up slowly too and I am 
starting to see the &quot;fruits&quot; of my marketing efforts, and even 

starting to get referrals from other healthcare practitioners! Yay!
That reminds me, I used to have one of those punching bags kids use 
to get rid of frustration, which had Bozo the clowns face on it... I 
should just imagine this guy when I am doing Shovelglove and really 
get into it! LOL
Get better and maybe you should go and get a licensed massage 
therapist to give you a nice mushing!
Well gotta get some coffee and get my hammer a whacking!
Long Live the Pact of Blood!
Love,
Deb

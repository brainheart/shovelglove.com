Hi Zack,

I don't think it's a matter of flab. While I tend not
to think &quot;oh my abs are super sore!&quot; I do notice they
are getting hit. Though not the primary muscle group
in any movement, they play a supporting role in just
about every one. It might just be that *relative* to
your arms they don't feel sore, so you don't really
notice it. I do think it evens out over time. I've
found that whenever I've started a new exercise
routine some oddball part of my body stood out as
being the most sore, though others had been hit plenty
hard as well. I guess it is possible that you are
doing the movements in a funny way so as to minimize
ab use, but I'd guess probably not. Take a look at the
videos on the site just in case. But I'm fairly
certain that being fat has nothing to do with it. 

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more
questions.

Reinhard

&gt; I have a question though. While my pecs and arms
&gt; feel like they have 
&gt; been getting a great workout, I don't feel anything
&gt; at all in my 
&gt; abs...am I doing something wrong? 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible that my abs are just so flabby that
&gt; the upperbody is 
&gt; doing all the work?

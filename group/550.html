Hi Reinhard,

I really appreciate your concern, but at this point there's not much 
to show a doctor. The swelling is 99% gone and there's just a little 
stiffness left. However, next week my sister who is a physical 
therapist will be in town and I'm going to ask her advice on how 
soon &amp; how much I should start doing SG again. 

The only other thing I can think of that might be a good addition to 
your site is a mention of tendonitis as a possible result of 
overdoing SG at the beginning. I was thinking I might have a mild 
form of this, but I just looked it up (see article here: 
<a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm">http://my.webmd.com/content/article/78/95608.htm</a>) 
and now I'm a bit 
confused because it doesn't mention swelling as a symptom. But it 
does mention shoveling as a possible cause :) Anyway, maybe some 
sort of blanket statement indicating that too much SG can have the 
same effects as too much shoveling, chopping wood, or any other 
heavy repetitive workout that you're not used to. This is totally up 
to you (it seems like obvious information, but people can be pretty 
dense).

BTW, have you ever done any sort of stretching before doing SG? I'm 
sure you don't need it now, but I wonder if that might be a good way 
to cut the risk of injury in the first few weeks.

thanks!
Ariel

&gt; Hi Ariel,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really sorry to hear this. I've never experienced
&gt; anything like it. Don't fool around, have it looked
&gt; at. Let me know if there are any additional warnings
&gt; you'd like me to splash on the home page.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

&gt; &gt; Thanks for all the great info Deb! To answer your
&gt; &gt; question, there is 
&gt; &gt; no heat or redness (and very little pain now). The
&gt; &gt; swelling starts 
&gt; &gt; about 5 inches below my elbow and continues to maybe
&gt; &gt; halfway up my 
&gt; &gt; upper arm. It's not huge, just noticeably puffy. But
&gt; &gt; it barely hurts 
&gt; &gt; anymore even when I press on the swollen area. The
&gt; &gt; muscle is still a 
&gt; &gt; bit tight underneath when I try to fully extend my
&gt; &gt; arm, but it's 
&gt; &gt; improving. The same is true for the right arm except
&gt; &gt; that (a) I can 
&gt; &gt; extend it fully and (b) no swelling.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If it's still weird after Friday I will try to get
&gt; &gt; medical attn. 
&gt; &gt; It's just so annoying trying to get in with a doctor
&gt; &gt; I haven't seen 
&gt; &gt; before...seems like every time I call one, either
&gt; &gt; they're not taking 
&gt; &gt; new patients or their 1st appt. is at least a month
&gt; &gt; out. I'll go to 
&gt; &gt; a walkin clinic if I have to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks again. You are a big help!
&gt; &gt;

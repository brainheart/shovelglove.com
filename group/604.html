Ahem. Correction: I did my first SG on the 4th, not the 11th. I did 
the second one, with a broom, somewhere around the 15th. That's how 
long it took me to recover. :P

&gt; Hi all, sorry I've been absent a few days. Just wanted to check in 

&gt; and let you know I did my 3rd pseudo-shovelglove last night (with 

&gt; the unweighted broom) and I am switching to the hammer tonight. My 

&gt; plan is to go very VERY slow and focus more on my form than 
anything 
&gt; else. The shoveling motion in particular still feels very awkward 

to 
&gt; me and I'd like to make sure I'm finding the most &quot;natural&quot; way 

&gt; possible to do it. Anyway, my arms are still fine (of course - 
&gt; they've been lifting a broom which probably weighs about half a 
&gt; pound ;) and my legs are just a little sore from all the 
&gt; squatting/lunging I've been putting into every movement. But this 

is 
&gt; the normal kind of soreness, nothing like what I had before.
&gt; 
&gt; NOTE to Renee: first, welcome! (from a true veteran of this group 
-

&gt; I've been here, oh, almost 3 weeks now! :) Second, I know you 
&gt; probably already did your first SG last night, but please please 
&gt; please listen to what Reinhard said about starting slow. I can't 
&gt; agree with that enough. I did my first SG with an 8 lb hammer on 
&gt; March 11. I went at it with great enthusiasm (well, at least great 

&gt; stubbornness) for 14 minutes, and spent the next week and a half 
&gt; recovering. My arms were VERY unhappy. So I hope you exercised 
more 
&gt; caution last night.
&gt; 
&gt; wish me luck tonight - 
&gt; Ariel

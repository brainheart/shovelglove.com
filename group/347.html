&gt; OK, I admit it.. I've been lagging.. for over a week. However, I 
must also admit, Deb, that your enthusiasm got me back on track. So, 
thank you!
....Hi Artie :)
I actually wrote you back, but maybe it fell through the &quot;holiday 

cracks&quot; :) Glad my enthusiasm got &quot;caught&quot; by someone else!
Carlos Santana once said &quot;The most contagious thing is enthusiasm&quot;!
I have had quite a week with way too many S days of the &quot;unofficial&quot; 

kind...Boooooo! Well it's Winter, and that is my bane...I pray for 
the return of warmer weather and the Sun! Even my SG has waned since 
my last post... I still love it though, I'm just having a winter 
doldrum which I pray will lift soon! :)

&gt; Does anyone here SG for more than the recommended 14 minutes? I
&gt; usually don't, because by about 11 minutes I'm looking at my watch 

and praying the next 3 minutes will go by quickly.. but I'm thinking 
of perhaps doing it twice a day, though that might be overkill. I 
don't want to burn out, either.

....You know, not to sound to dogmatic, but Reinhards reasons for 
keeping it to 14 minutes are very good psychology...Also overdoing 
anything really can result in an unnecessary injury, so why risk it?
Great news about your walking when you find an opportunity :)
I will try to find some inspiration there for me :)
I think the weather is supposed to warm up over the next few days, 
so I will plan a walk or two..
Peace and Happy New Year Shuggers :)
Deb

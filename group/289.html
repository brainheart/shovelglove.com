&gt; &gt; Today I'll have my first workout. When I get used to it, I'll 

&gt; probably start doing my workouts on a rebounder (mini-trampoline) 

&gt; for extra effect.
&gt; ....Hitting it or jumping on it while shovelglovving? You must be 

&gt; very coordinated, or have a Deathwish, LOL...

I'm very UNcoordinated.. but I'll try it anyway.. I was just talking about 

doing the chopping motions while on there, perhaps.

Well, I did have my first &quot;workout&quot;, and my arms feel like rubber. I didn't 

overdo it. I didn't do 14 minutes either. I didn't do all the reps. I didn't 

want to overdo it. Overzealousness leads to injury. Tomorrow's another day. I 

also learned to choke up (or is that down?) on the handle.. already had my first 

end of the handle collision with the ceiling. That (hopefully) won't happen 

again. My mom came in and thought I was nuts. I explained what I was doing. She 

still thought I was nuts. Oh well.

&gt; PS. In my next to last post I lied about the 16 lbs, just use a 12, 

&gt; but Kevin I am *still* up for an armwrestle!!!...But who 
&gt; knows...Maybe in a year or so...
&gt; Good Luck Al :)

It's &quot;Art&quot;, not Al. But thanks, anyway. :)

I went to one store, they wanted $40.00 for an 8 pounder! At the next store 

down the road, it was $21.99 for the 10 pounder I bought. It's like, hey, I 

don't NEED a lifetime guarantee on the handle.. I'm not going to hit anything 

with it (intentionally, anyway). They looked at me like I was nuts. I get that 

look alot.

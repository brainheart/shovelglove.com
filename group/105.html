Hi there

I was just trying another move with the hammer. I don't claim it as new, but it was 
interesting to play with.

curl &amp; jab

with the SG in you right hand like the flip lever position, stand with the left leg 
slightly forward of the right.
Curl the SG - like flip the lever, then at the top punch/jab forward while twisting 
at the hips.

The challenge I found was &quot;pulling&quot; the punch, decelerating the 
SG.

I like the movement for a few reasons - 

there is transverse movement with the addition of the twisting jab and I think moving 
in the extra plane adds in a functional sense.

there is a satisfaction in punching,

there is scope for a street fighting scenario...

By the way, the other day I mentioned the site <a href="http://www.goanimal.com">http://www.goanimal.com</a>

I've just read the book from the site - Play as if Your Life Depends on It. and woudl 
recommend it for soem thought provoking ideas on exercise. As I said I don't buy all 
of his anthropology, but there are some great ideas in there about functional 
exercise and the need to have fun, avoiding the tyrrany of progressions, programs 
etc. It is very much consistent with a lot of ideas in the shovelglove approach - 
functional movements, fun, part of life etc

Chris

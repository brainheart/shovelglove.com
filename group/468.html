I do stretch, although I don't like it. Probably the most important muscle groups to 
stretch are in the hips, from all the sitting we do, they can get tight. I'm not 
saying you need to be able to do the splits or anything, as that's rather specialized 
in itself. One of the best stretches for your hip flexors you can do during your 
Urban Rangering (got this from Pavel). While keeping upright and moving, push your 
hips forward a bit. If you do this right, it doesn't screw up your walking, and you 
get a nice, pleasant stretch in the fronts of your hips. Pavel refers to this style 
of walking as leading with your belly or leading with your hips or something. I guess 
that's better imagery. He claims that this is really good for treating and preventing 
tight hips. Debbie, any opinions?

Anyone here stretch?

I have to confess, I don't. Except what comes
unconsciously, by yawning, etc. I don't notice any ill
effects except an occasionally guilty conscience.

Am I missing anything? I haven't done any research on
this score, but the logic of &quot;useful movements&quot; would
seem to indicate not. Did farmers and hunters stretch?
Maybe the range of their natural movements (which,
remember, we're imitating with shovelglove) is
sufficient that dedicated stretching time isn't
necessary? Maybe it's only the artificial, constricted
movements of weightlifters and other &quot;specialist&quot;
exercisers that make stretching necessary.

What I do do to cool down is a bit of shadowboxing. I
don't know the first thing about boxing so I'm sure
what I do is pretty laughable to the trained eye, and
I doubt it accomplishes much in the way of stretching,
but it's fun, and a great excuse to admire your
shovelglove induced musculature if you do it in front
of mirror (if a little autosexual). It also kills time
while I wait for my charming victorian plumbing to get
the shower water hot enough. 21 hooks to the head, 21
hooks to the body, 21 uppercuts, 21 &quot;sneaky stomach
jabs,&quot; 14 straight rights, 14 straight lefts.

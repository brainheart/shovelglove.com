&gt; They are not to be confused with lactation
&gt; consultants, or &quot;nipple nazis&quot; as my wife refers to
&gt; them.

Why? Do they tell the nipple &quot;achtung&quot; and expect it to stand at 

attention? LOL


Ah yes mammaries, I mean memories :)
I can remember the biting agony of those first few weeks of nursing 
Richard...His half sisters, I used to take care of would roar with 
laughter as I yelped in pain! Who knew such a small creature could 
suck so damn hard?!
The key to making milk is to drink plenty of extra water.... and 
also take in sufficient dietary calcium (cheese, etc...)
If you really want to get the waterworks flowing, have some beer, 
not much is necessary, and no, the baby won't wind up in AA.
The brewers yeast does something and it is unbelievable how much 
milk gets produced after having a short beer.
If your wife isn't a drinker or just hates beer, you can buy brewers 
yeast plain, in some health food store, and then sprinkle it onto 
popcorn....I tried the beer method (it worked, almost too well as I 
was busting out of my shirt! LOL)
but haven't tried the other...My friend suggested the other way of 
using the brewers yeast as kindof making popcorn that &quot;sortof&quot; 

tastes like it has white cheddar cheese on it....
PS...According to Godwin's law this thread should self destruct in 
10 seconds.

The gondola thing isn't *really* like rowing, as much as it is like 
pushing a raft off the banks of a muddy river bed. Maybe one day 
when I feel ready for public scrutiny, I will invest in a computer 
camera...But we are a long,long, way off from that :)
Hope your bruise is better
Deb

Please note that its an exercise technique that I have only started 
used after some while doing bodybuilding and full contact, and its in 
the spirit of preparation for ultimate fighting. 

A fighter has got to push his limits and endure pain. If you are just 
willing to stay in shape, a good sweat will do it. However, if you are 

serious about training there is a stage when you WILL reach BURN 
point, and you know that thats when you are really training, pushing 
your body out of its comfort zone.

For the beginners, warming up is EXTREMELY important, trying to reach 
BURN point without warming up first is like asking for trouble.

For semi athletes, people who train everyday, your body is always 
asked to do some kind of effort, be it jogging or training, so you 
might say you can train with less self compassion. 

If you been there, BURN point, please let me know about it and about 
how it feels. I think its a kind of high for an athlete, to be 
actively pushing his or her limits further.

I use the BURN point technique only when im eager to do it, after a 
BURN point session using chairs or wheights, I usually need 48 hours 
to recover, during which I jog or do full contact, and kind of take it 

easy not to over stress my muscles.

Once again BURN point is the hard way. Still is in my opinion the 
best way. If you dont take your exercise to BURN point you will be 
evolving within your comfort zone. Your body is going to think, I can 
handle that... No need to build muscles, no need to tap into my fat 
reserves... All is well, in 40 minutes he or she will be done and im 
going to be able to have a good shower and lay down in the couch 
starring at tv.

With BURN point your body is more like, The End is near ! Repent ! 
Build muscles, it might be your only chance to stay in the evolution 
game. Where are those fat reserves ? Need fuel, got to burn all I got. 

Once on the couch, your body will think damn it hurts everywhere, cant 

stay starring at the tv till 1 in the morning, I need rest. You will 
be sleeping like a baby by 9 o clock. In the morning your body will 
still hurt but once its past the hurt, you just got yourself a meaner, 

leaner and more resistant body.

How does BURN point apply to shovelglove ? I think you experienced 
it. All of you. Aint no way youre going to be training with a 
sledgehammer without feeling a burn in your muscles at some point, 
especially if you are untrained otherwise. Now the spirit of BURN 
technique is to hang in there as long as you can. But when I think of 
it, can be dangerous with a sledge hammer, because sometimes you 
overestimate your strenght and you have to let go whatever weight you 
are lifting, its ok with a chair, but with a hammer ? I dont think so.

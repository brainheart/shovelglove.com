Hi Kai,

I'm glad to hear you're finally noticing it in your
abs. I think the trouble is your other parts get so
slaughtered in the beginning that you don't notice
right away.

I too notice and enjoy the &quot;get out of bed NOW&quot; side
effect. I think if it were a longer stretch of time
you might be tempted to say &quot;forget it, it's too late&quot;
and roll back over asleep. But 14 minutes extra sleep
just ain't worth it. Shovelglove gives you the nudge
to wake up without the excuse of its being too much.

I'm glad you find the phases helpful. Unfortunately,
it's not merely &quot;progressive.&quot; I just hadn't thought
of some of the moves till later. Some of them might
have been great to start with. 

I have fond memories of phase 4. I was there for a
long time. It's tricky to fit in the extra moves,
timewise, of 5a until you're very practiced. But just
cut some of the reps of the other moves and you should
be OK.

Keep on doing what you're doing, taking it slow.
There's no rush. The magic 3 weeks is right around the
corner.

&gt; Short: I've never felt better! I'd recommend
&gt; shovelgloving to just
&gt; about anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; Long: Well, here I am about two weeks later and it's
&gt; clear that
&gt; shovelgloving works. I thought that sore stage would
&gt; be more intense,
&gt; but it was nothing (to me)! My body gladly accepted
&gt; the routine and
&gt; I'm having a lot of fun now. Once you get hooked,
&gt; it's hard NOT to sg
&gt; every day, including weekends (which I agree should
&gt; be a rest period).
&gt; I'm a really bad morning person, but I've found that
&gt; the routine
&gt; actually helps me get up (in addition to the usual
&gt; exercise benefit of
&gt; feeling more energized and alert throughout the
&gt; day). After so long
&gt; of, well, just being a geek with minimal muscle
&gt; mass, I have to admit
&gt; that I wish I started earlier. It only took a few
&gt; days to see
&gt; noticeable results in the arms and shoulder, but now
&gt; my abs are
&gt; responding too, which is a fairly alien feeling to
&gt; me. :) Needless to
&gt; say, the routine has motivated me to continue with
&gt; the routine and
&gt; there's nothing stronger than the force of habit. 14
&gt; minutes, brilliant!
&gt; 
&gt; For the routine itself I've been referring to
&gt; Reinhard's 4th phase
&gt; (felt like a pretty good beginner routine for me),
&gt; but I'm bumping it
&gt; up to his 5th phase starting Monday (not exactly,
&gt; but fitting in
&gt; &quot;stoke the oven&quot; and &quot;tuck the bales&quot;). I'm sticking
&gt; with the 8 lbs.
&gt; sledge for awhile longer (although it's already
&gt; feeling a little easy).
&gt; 
&gt; No sg photos this week, maybe later.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again!
&gt; 
&gt; - Kai

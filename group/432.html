&gt; Deb,
&gt; 
&gt; Way to go! I've still been shovelin along...just bad
&gt; about posting workouts. Churning butter is my favorite
&gt; drill..what's yours?
.....Oh that would be the Makita with a 3/4 inch bit, huh huh huh!
Drill? Well I ain't in no army but I must say I usually love to do, 
my previously most hated one, hoist the sack...Lately I have been 
doing mostly freestyle for most of the time.. This usually consists 
of dancing around and pretending I am in Crouching Tiger Hidden 
Dragon, kicking someones ass! LOL :)
Actually I am getting pretty nice control of the thing and have 
almost been using it like a baton! Good thing it's not slippery and 
I have a &quot;Fearsome grip&quot; as Reinhard would say :)

&gt; Whereas sg is great i kinda miss bashing an old tractor tire w/ my 

sledge it was great for stress relief. 
...That would get the blood a'pumpin :)
When I smashed my scale last year, it hurt my hands like heck, so I 
am opting out of smashing things for now, unless it's for a very 
short time, or unless they &quot;had it coming to them!&quot; ha ha...

I have been trying to spead the word about sg esp to my friends who 
want to work out but think they have to spend a bundle on gym fees
that deters some people..(i know i prefered kettlebells and privacy 
to Mulletheads at the local gym)

....Maybe we can all start local chapters of Shovelglove and have a 
once a month meeting for &quot;expatriot gym *non* mulletheaded&quot; fitness 

people? It could be a gang, not a club! :)
Too bad you don't live in NY Richard, we could duel! :)

Well have a better one. 
....Now I will :)
&gt; Love, Peace and Chicken Grease :)
Richard Spears

....Take it easy greasy : )!
Deb

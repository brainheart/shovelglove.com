Hi Rich,

&gt;How long is your rest time b/w drills? 30 seconds?
&gt; one &gt;minute? No rest at all?

I don't rest at all between sets. Gives me a bit of
cardio, I guess. Given the number of reps, the weight
of the sledge, the variety of the movements, and the
length of time I've been doing it, this isn't a
problem. I'm not tempted to rest. Sure each movement
is hard, but hard in a different enough way from the
last that I don't feel I'm straining myself unduly by
going straight to it. Naturally, do what suits your
reps/weight/variety/experience/temperament.

Hi Deb,

&gt; But where does 24 come into this picture?...

The phrase &quot;twenty-four seven&quot; intruding
inappropriately from my subconscious plus too fast
typing minus proofreading.

&gt; by 
&gt; having a strict numbers based workout, beyond the 14
&gt; minute (and 
&gt; very excellent, workout encouraging, parameter)is
&gt; kindof mental and 
&gt; restrictive....

But it's not strict. 14 minutes every N day remains
the only hard parameter. But soft doesn't mean
imprecise. I'm going to do *something* every N day,
and I don't want it to *require* a whole lot of
decision making. Having a default doesn't prevent me
from being original on a given morning, it just makes
it optional. I've gotten a very good sense of what I
can do in 14 minutes, so the default might as well be
specific. If I have a better idea that morning, some
inspiration, then I'll do something else. But usually
I don't. I post the routines on the site so people 1)
can get a better idea as to the precise inputs that
make my output 2) can have real examples to help come
up with their own personal defaults.

&gt; PS... re the Yahoo groupies, did you ever think of
&gt; doing a quicktime 
&gt; movie for the whole 14 minutes?

Yes, but 14 minutes of even the pathetic quality video
I've got on the site would take ages to download. But
cafepress lets you sell dvds so maybe I'll look into
that at some point. Low production values would be
part of the charm, naturally.

Reinhard

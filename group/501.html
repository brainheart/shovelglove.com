It has been a great winter for shovelglove, hasn't it?

I keep thinking &quot;I've got to stop, leave something for
the plow, the neighbors are going to think you're
crazy.&quot;

There ought to be some kind of service to match up
functional exercisers with manual labor projects...
maybe a charity even. Volunteer chain gangs of model
citizens.

&gt; Well today I was shovelling the, hmmm, maybe 6 or 7
&gt; inches of snow 
&gt; out there with Richard... It's good work I tell you,
&gt; but the 
&gt; weirdest thought was passing through my head (well
&gt; maybe not *the* 
&gt; weirdest..LOL)
&gt; I was actually trying to imagine myself doing
&gt; *SHOVELGLOVE* to make 
&gt; to snow shovelling more fun?!? Whaahhh????
&gt; Aren't we supposed to be pretending to do real
&gt; everyday things to 
&gt; make the Shovelglove more &quot;real world&quot;?
&gt; Well maybe I just prefer a fake world today? LOL :)
&gt; 
&gt; And I was just flippin that snow every which way!
&gt; LOL..
&gt; It's funny how that &quot;throwing off the weight&quot; as you
&gt; dump the snow, 
&gt; kind of &quot;surprises&quot; me each time now! LOL... 
&gt; Well my perspective seems to be changing for the
&gt; better daily! And I 
&gt; am enjoying the day to day tasks that just seem so
&gt; much easier and 
&gt; fun since I started here in August...I'm remembering
&gt; the time I went 
&gt; to hammer in a nail and got my medium/large hammer
&gt; out of the 
&gt; toolchest and started to burst out laughing because
&gt; it felt like one 
&gt; of those &quot;Fisher Price&quot; whack the plastic tool table
&gt; hammers and 
&gt; seemed to have &quot;Shrunk&quot; LOL :) Well I'm getting
&gt; stronger no doubt 
&gt; and I am proud of that!
&gt; 
&gt; Well I guess I am now officially a sledge addict...
&gt; Now I can't wait for all this snow to melt and temps
&gt; to rise high 
&gt; enough to go out and get medieval on that tire :)
&gt; Peace and Love,
&gt; Deb

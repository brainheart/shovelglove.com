And, potentially, make the upgrade smaller. I have a 10# hammer. 
Going from 8# to 12# is a 50% increase. That's a big weight increase 
levered out there on the end of a 3' handle.

Or maybe just use the big hammer for the really easy moves? And 
there's always just move faster...

It's great to hear you've stuck with it this long. I've been reading 
Reinhard's gospel of schedulistic insignificance more closely over 
the past few days. My work schedule skyrocketed, and I'd been too 
busy to put in my normal 25 minutes on many days. I'm getting 
religion. 

Fourteen minutes for me.

&gt; Hi Kai,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm happy to hear &quot;shugging&quot; is going so well for you
&gt; (I'm going to have to collect all these endearing
&gt; terms that have been proposed in the groups into a
&gt; single page soon). Though it does sound like you might
&gt; be ready to upgrade soon, beware The Progress Trap
&gt; (more fearsome than the Spoctopid). It's better to do
&gt; too light too long than the other way around. To use a
&gt; business term, you don't want to promote yourself to
&gt; your level of incompetence. You might want to force
&gt; yourself to go a month longer or so at the current
&gt; weight just as an exercise in stickwithitude. Make the
&gt; upgrade a reward, not an obligation.

&gt; &gt; Hey all -
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like mixing words together and coming up with
&gt; &gt; terms like &quot;shugging&quot;,
&gt; &gt; so I'm going to support that and hope it sticks. As
&gt; &gt; an example, I drew
&gt; &gt; an illustration of a spoctopid (that's a
&gt; &gt; squid/octopus hybrid from
&gt; &gt; outer space) busting through our front door as a
&gt; &gt; reminder to my
&gt; &gt; roommate to lock the door when she leaves. So far
&gt; &gt; it's been fairly
&gt; &gt; effective. Speaking of illustrations, that crane
&gt; &gt; movement stick figure
&gt; &gt; had me tears [of joy...?]!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is my fifth week shuggin' (time flies) and I
&gt; &gt; haven't missed a day
&gt; &gt; yet, even though I've been fighting off a nasty cold
&gt; &gt; for the past
&gt; &gt; week. Don't worry, I'm feeling better each day, so
&gt; &gt; while it might mean
&gt; &gt; a slightly faster recovery to truly rest and not
&gt; &gt; shug' while I'm sick,
&gt; &gt; keeping up with it has not appeared to make things
&gt; &gt; worse. Then again,
&gt; &gt; that's probably because I can sleepwalk through my
&gt; &gt; routine now...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The churning butter movement (previously the most
&gt; &gt; dreaded part of my
&gt; &gt; routine) burns a lot less than before, which means
&gt; &gt; going 14 minutes
&gt; &gt; with a 8lbs sledge is a total cakewalk now. That
&gt; &gt; said, I'm going to
&gt; &gt; try a 12lbs starting Monday and hope it makes me
&gt; &gt; sweat more. I doubt
&gt; &gt; I'll need anything more than that for quite some
&gt; &gt; time!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This group is great, I've been very amused by recent
&gt; &gt; posts. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Kai

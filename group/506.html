&gt; Hi Debbie! Thanks for the welcome! I'm seriously thinking of going 

&gt; to Home Depot this evening. Do they have a good selection of 
&gt; sledgehammers? anyone know? I'm guessing I should start w/an 8 lb. 

&gt; one since I have so little upper body strength - Deb, what's your 

&gt; female perspective on this?
&gt; tx - Ariel
.....Well, I say, get one that won't kill you but challenges you 
still...Unless you demand something of your muscles they just won't 
get much of a workout...It should feel like something good and solid 
but not so heavy that you can't manipulate it... Just fiddle around 
trying them out...
I have no clue how big or little you are and this is really 
something very individual...I use my hands and arms alot in my work 
as I am a massage therapist (you should see the look on my clients 
faces when I tell them I exercise with a sledgehammer at home! 
Usually I assure them it won't be part of their treatment!) If you 
feel, when you pick up an eight pounder, that it's not too easy, 
then get that one... Be prepared for the first one or two workouts 
to be a bit hard.. it will get much more comfortable fairly quickly, 
but just don't do what I did the first time I SG'd, which was to put 
on LedZepII with a 12 lb one and go ballistic! LOL... Only go half 
ballistic at the beginning...there's no need for stupidity here (I 
am stupid enough for all of us as you will come to learn from my 
posts! LOL)
Okay, so go forth and prosper at home depot...Expect to pay 
somewhere in the ballpark of 20 to 25 bucks...
So Biffity bop to you and let us know how it all goes down girl!
Deb :)

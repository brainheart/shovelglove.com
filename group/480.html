Hi all, I know this isn't really directly SG related, but in a way 
it is... My almost nine year old son Richard is out clearing my car 
off with my plastic snow shovel right now... He was so stoked to get 
out and shovel the world when he saw the snow...
I think when there's a job to do, you don't really think about &quot;hey 

I'm going to work out now&quot; etc... and somehow the fact that theres a 

purpose behind the working, adds a dimension of satisfaction, and 
real drive, which is lacking from working out divorced from 
meaning... I think the innate forces which drive us to survive are 
always there.. it's up to us to tap into that shared drive to bring 
life to our practice... For Richard, who by the way holds the shovel 
in weird awkward ways, it's pretty cute to watch!, it doesn't matter 
how he gets the job done or how long he is doing it, just that he 
gets it done....
It's a bug up the bum that can't be killed! LOL :)
When doing an important task where you have a very specific goal, 
its easy to stay focused on it with such tunnel vision...
Well at least it seems so for my little guy. And now he's off 
making an &quot;igloo&quot; LOL :) Maybe he is part Inuit :) Actually he is a 

very small percentage Native American, but from the Choctaw tribe, 
so no igloos there...
Food for thought :)
PS.. Thanks Storm for the fun posts from the other &quot;Iron&quot; group and 

Stumptuous too... yes she was funny and smart and obviously in 
phenomenal shape.. Nice that she didn't peddle millions of &quot;Mega 
this&quot; and &quot;Creatine that&quot;,,,etc... advertisements..How refreshing! 

I thought it was funny to see how the guys there were wondering 
whether Reinhard was just stealing some other dudes idea...I mean, 
what's there to steal? It's based on the natural movements of tool 
holding humans... We all share that. Reinhard was just smart enough 
to realize what a powerful force this is...It's not just &quot;metaphor&quot; 

alone, but metaphor is a nice way to tap into it. Useful movements 
are in our makeup,, in our cellular memory :) They vibrate with 
that &quot;morphic resonance&quot; you posted about a while back :)
I was laughing when the group kept referred to our Rein as &quot;That 
shovel guy!&quot; LOL :)
I'm really proud to be part of this group...This elite group of 
&quot;Shovel Guys!&quot; :)
I think today I will &quot;Chop trees&quot; in honor of George W.... No not 

Texas George... The first guy :)!
Oh and a little side note on our Richards idea of Tabata SG... I 
tried this for a few days with &quot;hoist the sack&quot;, two handed this 

time, and these were the results...
1st interval of twenty seconds= 20 reps
2nd=19 reps
then during the ten second break I thought &quot;hey! I'm doing it! I'm 

doing it! Maybe I'll just lose a rep each set!&quot;
3rd interval, I got to 3 reps and then total muscle failure! LOLOLOL!
Yep Richard it's monstrous... I'm going to work on this gradually 
and let you know how it goes :)
Have good ones today guys!
Peace and Love,
Debbie

Hi Storm,

This does look interesting. I'm on a &quot;book diet&quot; right
now for budgetary reasons, but I think I'll wishlist
it.

Amazon link:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0926888072/everydaysyste-20/102-0494050-5332924">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0926888072/everydaysyste-20/102-0494050-5332924</a>

(group members: if you're interested and not on a book
diet, buy through the link above and I get a tiny cut)

I'm honored that you would compare me to this guy!
He's way more hard core than I am (a lot of *you* seem
way more hard core than I am!), but I do see the
similarity in kind, if not degree. Shovelglove is
almost like Steve Justa light, for folks who don't
have a scrapyard or nebraskan wilderness to tool
around in. I'll stick a link to this on the home page
in the section where I mention kettlebells and other
similar stuff.

&gt; 
&gt; In case anyone was wondering who this Steve Justa
&gt; character that Reinhard keeps getting compared to,
&gt; he is a monster (at one point, his bodyweight was
&gt; 365#, but upon realizing it was a struggle to tie
&gt; his shoes, he began a very high repetition lifting
&gt; program and hard farm labor. The result was that
&gt; his bodyweight dropped to a lean 240#. His book,
&gt; Rock, Iron, Steel: The Book of Strength is very
&gt; creative and against the grain, but he is about as
&gt; hardcore as they come. He is a Nebraskan manual
&gt; labor guy, and he sets up training programs that
&gt; compliment his performance on the job (whether that
&gt; job is loading 80# hay bales, building or tearing
&gt; down bridges, or any number of hard, physically
&gt; demanding work.) rather than compromise it. This
&gt; means that while he loves hard work, he fully
&gt; understands that the nasal blood erupting, nervous
&gt; system draining, soreness and exhaustion enducing
&gt; programs of many guys are of no use to him, however,
&gt; he has torn calluses (when you do a partial
&gt; deadlift of 2050 pounds, of course something's
&gt; occasionally going to give!). 
&gt; THe reason some guy thought Reinhard borrowed from
&gt; Justa is that he dedicates an entire chapter in his
&gt; book to something called &quot;The Shovel Lift.&quot; The
&gt; weight is at one end of a pole, one hand grabs the
&gt; handle about 18&quot; from the weight, the other is far
&gt; enough back to gain leverage. The apparatus is
&gt; deadlifted, and in a controlled manner, rotated back
&gt; behind the body, and rotated to the front. The
&gt; movement is reversed and repeated, and both sides
&gt; are trained (Change hand positions). Mr. Justa has
&gt; done this lift with over 200 pounds (there is a
&gt; picture, or I wouldn't believe it.). There are also
&gt; variations of the shovel lift, but you get the idea.
&gt; So, if two guys with totally different backgrounds
&gt; who know nothing of each other independently come up
&gt; with vaguely similar ideas...Oh well.
&gt; You can see reviews of Justa's book at amazon.com,
&gt; and you can see his book and a list of the articles
&gt; he wrote for MILO at ironmind.com. I'm trying to
&gt; keep the links coming.

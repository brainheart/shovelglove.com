Hi Debbie,

I've never had a problem with this, not sure why, I
sweat alright. Maybe it's just my fearsome grip? More
likely it's something that you get used to quickly.
With experience you realize that it's not really going
to fly out of your hand. Or maybe you just develop my
fearsome grip. Or both.

In the meantime, I'd just focus on making sure you're
doing the movements in a slow and controlled manner.
If your not going a hundred miles per hour things are
less likely to go flying. The slippage can actually be
useful: as a reminder not to go too fast (which has
plenty of other dangers as well).

As for the calluses, I always think of that Dickens
story or wherever it was where the evil overseer can
tell by looking at the hitherto sheltered hero's hands
that he'd &quot;never worked a day in his life.&quot; It may
still be true in my case, by that old definition of
work, but you sure couldn't tell from looking at my
hands.

Happy to hear it's going well for you,

Reinhard

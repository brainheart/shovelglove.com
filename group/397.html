....Hey if you really want to look foolish, strap a rubber chicken 
to the end of the SG...Now that would be ridiculous (but funny)
So &quot;oops&quot; My bad... I thought Art wrote about the shirt falling 

off, but it was you Mike...Oh well, keep your shirts and pants on 
anyway whoever you are! LOL :)
Good luck with your SG fashion predicament. I'm sure you will figure 
it out :)
&gt; 
&gt; My arms are killing me. It hurts to type this. I'm gonna be SORE
&gt; tomorrow. BUT, tomorrow I will do it again. 

....My most sore day was the first day... and I wasn't sore, so much 
as just drained... really really drained! Of course I put on Led 
Zeppelin II and went ballistic! Too fast and furious for a first 
time (hee hee)
I felt completely comfortable by the second or third time.. big 
difference... Try going a little slower in the beginning, just to 
warm up. Congrats on your first round of SG!
See you later :)
Peace,
Deb

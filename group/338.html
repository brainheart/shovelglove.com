&gt; I haven't come up with any new moves in a while, but

....LOL lucky number seven?
Hey if it gets you fired up and ready to go, great :)
But where does 24 come into this picture?...
I think Richard would have to correct your times tables! LOL.
Seriously though, I couldn't work at that pace *for my life*! Plus 
I must make mention of a strange paradox here...Just to be a pain in 
the ass and kill some more braincells and time :)
In all other aspects of your everyday systems, you seem to like 
keeping things simple and *I thought* didn't like to be an 
accountant much... Hey it's clear that your routine works for you, 
but I am going to be a little bit of a devils advocate and question 
if you, too, can see that theres a bit of a paradox here in that by 
having a strict numbers based workout, beyond the 14 minute (and 
very excellent, workout encouraging, parameter)is kindof mental and 
restrictive....At least to me... again, clearly with good results, 
but somehow seems to take away from the tenets of simplicity and 
unconscious.... *I* don't like to count as I workout, but once in a 
while I will say, okay lets see how long my body likes to do this 
one and I might peek at the clock to see how many minutes I 
did...And I don't usually do that... Or maybe I'll look to see how 
long it takes for me to feel really warmed up, as a general 
indication of my energy level and general condition...
My only rule these days is not to skip it and go at whatever pace 
feels comfortable for my body within the 14 minutes :) Usually this 
is a very slow and deliberate pace, because I am a slowpoke :)
I almost skipped out yesterday, but caught myself in the act and did 
my routine at 10pm! NO WHINING! LOL :)

PS... re the Yahoo groupies, did you ever think of doing a quicktime 
movie for the whole 14 minutes? Then newbies could watch you rock a 
little baby, while running a vacuum, and flinging the sg around as 
projectile sweat flys in all directions :) I bet it would become a 
cult classic!
Love and Admiration,
Deb
Great Neck groupie :)
PPS...How many pounds is the little cutie these days? Don't ask why 
it's a surprise... My guess would be around 9 or 10? Let me know :)

&gt; I believe, and maybe you can add credence or blow away my theory, 

that squats are best done by coming up on your toes when you are in 
the squatted position. It seems to take all the stress off your 
knees (in fact, squats were the cure to my low-level knee pain - 
they don't hurt at all anymore, ever). If you try to keep your heels 
on the floor, they hurt.
....Hey T.K. :)
Kevin I don't wan't to blow away your theory, but make an educated 
guess at what's up with your knees. Sounds like your squats are 
helping to strengthen your quads, which are often the root of knee 
pain, if they are tight...If it hurts to have your foot flat on the 
floor and doesn't when you plantar flex your feet (ie up on your 
toes) then my guess is you have some tight calf muscles there, 
probably the Gastrocnemius... the origins of this two headed muscle 
are the epicondyles of the femur (ie above the knee on the sides) 
Putting your foot into a plantar flexed, on point, position, 
shortens the muscle, and then you won't get pain from a 
stretch...But that tightness can be helped by daily static 
stretching your hands over your toes while sitting with your legs 
straight out in front of you. Mind you, no ballistic bouncing, that 
only shortens the muscle more...Static and held for 20-30 seconds. 
Before and after your exercise...Glad that your exercise helps. 
Most people in pain are usually fairly inactive so keep doing what 
you like as you are taking care of your God given &quot;temple&quot; :)

&gt; Debbie, you are doing most excellent. I am still on track, but 
haven't shovelgloved yet today. For me the hardest part is just 
starting.
.....Thanks Joe, you are a most excellent SG partner, and I 
appreciate your posts :) We all know that Reinhard is doing SG, but 
frequent or at least, once in a while, check ins from others too, 
really keeps the SG &quot;pulse&quot; alive! :)

The pact is strong. There is no going back! I have found that there 
are so many mental blocks in our thinking that it is a very 
formidable task to undo them... Just find what works for you, be it 
an imaginary voice saying &quot;hey Melvin Punymeyer! Move your 
ahhhhssss!&quot; ala Arnold, or, be it hopes that you will turn out to 

look super buff or just feel great having fun! Turning on the music 
which you play for SG is really a good one, because after you start 
to associate working out with a particular song, like Reinhard says, 
you start the Pavlovian &quot;behavior&quot;... It's *good* programming!

But if all fails, remember I am willing to come out there for you 
Joe so be warned! :) LOL
So you mentioned that you are a rural dude..
How rural are you? A farm pond sounds like good fun, unless the cows 
use it too!
Or if it has,,,,,,
Leaches!

See you on Urban Ranger for my blog for this morning :)

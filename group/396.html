Hey Art :) It could have been worse... You could have had your 
pants fall down instead! LOL :)
I don't really have a sweater I can spare, so I use a folded up 
chartruse and yellow hand towel and I used clear packing tape all 
around it to keep it on...it reminds me of the &quot;wrapped&quot; furniture 

that was all the rage in most 60's Flatbush provincial homes :)
Unwrapped could be really bad if you drop the thing, but mainly I 
think it just goes against the &quot;wacky&quot; SG ethic of sweaterborn 

originality, you wouldn't want to have a *boring* plain sledgehammer 
would you? LOL :)

Duct tape is too ugly for me, but that would work too :)
I'm all off schedule today but I will be wielding the mighty sledge 
later before bedtime... My chiropractor had an opening and I went in 
for an adjustment/massage to relieve some major, built up stress 
from last/this week....
If you don't mind me suggesting this, I wouldn't do SG or any 
exercise in 8 degree weather... Muscles like warmth not cold and my 
guess is that you don't want to lose your new apartment because the 
landlady thinks you are a wacko serial killer...
So low ceilings,,, basement apartment? I remember that you are a 
tall guy... You will figure out your body mechanics so you can do it 
in a small space, I'm sure :)
Good luck Michael, and remember that the first few days are probably 
going to be the hardest.. It does get easier once your muscles and 
mind adjust to using the SG :) Keep us posted!
Richard,,,you keep on trucking too :)
(wasn't that a great Hot Tuna song? :)

Have a great night guys!
I am so happy to see people writing here these days!
Keep the pact sacred :)
Debbie

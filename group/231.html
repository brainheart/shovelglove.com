Hi Debbie,

&gt; Hi Shovelers :)
&gt; How's it going? I just had a nice little sg
&gt; workout...I have to 
&gt; admit that it is not a habit yet and I wish it was
&gt; because it always 
&gt; makes me feel good after and I really value it's
&gt; effect on me...
&gt; Tried to do the &quot;hoist the sack&quot; with one arm, just
&gt; to see how hard 
&gt; it would be...It's not happening any time soon...I
&gt; don't know how 
&gt; you can do *that* one Reinhard! 

This is why lighter can be good to start with :-). But
it's not a contest, two hands is fine.

&gt; Another thing I was wondering is, what time do you
&gt; do the 14 minutes?
&gt; As soon as you get up, pre-shower, without any
&gt; breakfast?

This is how I did it pre-baby. It's a little more
complicated now, but that's usually what I try to do.
Because of baby duties, some days I have to do it
after dinner (post on this subject pending). I
wouldn't obsess over the timing: delegate that to your
daily self. Your daily self has this job to do: 14
minutes of shovelglove, and should be able to figure
that out without micromanagement. 14 minutes is short
enough that you can remember right before bed and
still squeeze it in. No make ups, no excuses. If you
miss a day, you wince, and try not to miss the next
one, that's all. That being said, it's good to have a
*default* time at least...

&gt; Hmmm...I 
&gt; just don't want to make any more excuses to skip
&gt; days, but (hey I'm 
&gt; making an excuse now...) when I have to get Richard
&gt; off to school, I 
&gt; don't really enjoy the idea of having to do my SG
&gt; while all 
&gt; the &quot;getting ready&quot; commotion is happening. Got any
&gt; ideas on 
&gt; creating an &quot;inviolate&quot; time slot?

When does Richard do his homework? Or watch inspector
gadget or whatever kids are watching now days? That
might be a better default than hectic mornings.

&gt; So here is a nice and pretty interesting view of the
&gt; Abs which I dug 
&gt; up, from an article by a very famous &quot;Rolfer&quot; named
&gt; Thomas 
&gt; Myers...He specializes in Myofascial pathways and
&gt;

I'll have to wait till the weekend to digest this, but
the pictures are great (and the link works).

Reinhard

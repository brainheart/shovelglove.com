In case anyone was wondering who this Steve Justa character that Reinhard keeps 
getting compared to, he is a monster (at one point, his bodyweight was 365#, but upon 
realizing it was a struggle to tie his shoes, he began a very high repetition lifting 
program and hard farm labor. The result was that his bodyweight dropped to a lean 
240#. His book, Rock, Iron, Steel: The Book of Strength is very creative and against 
the grain, but he is about as hardcore as they come. He is a Nebraskan manual labor 
guy, and he sets up training programs that compliment his performance on the job 
(whether that job is loading 80# hay bales, building or tearing down bridges, or any 
number of hard, physically demanding work.) rather than compromise it. This means 
that while he loves hard work, he fully understands that the nasal blood erupting, 
nervous system draining, soreness and exhaustion enducing programs of many guys are 
of no use to him, however, he has torn calluses (when you do a partial
deadlift of 2050 pounds, of course something's occasionally going to give!). 

THe reason some guy thought Reinhard borrowed from Justa is that he dedicates an 
entire chapter in his book to something called &quot;The Shovel Lift.&quot; The 
weight is at one end of a pole, one hand grabs the handle about 18&quot; from the 
weight, the other is far enough back to gain leverage. The apparatus is deadlifted, 
and in a controlled manner, rotated back behind the body, and rotated to the front. 
The movement is reversed and repeated, and both sides are trained (Change hand 
positions). Mr. Justa has done this lift with over 200 pounds (there is a picture, or 
I wouldn't believe it.). There are also variations of the shovel lift, but you get 
the idea. So, if two guys with totally different backgrounds who know nothing of each 
other independently come up with vaguely similar ideas...Oh well.
You can see reviews of Justa's book at amazon.com, and you can see his book and a 
list of the articles he wrote for MILO at ironmind.com. I'm trying to keep the links 
coming.

&gt; Hi Deb! My &quot;silly fat arm&quot; is no longer fat. But it is still 

silly, 


....Hey tell that silly arm to stop joking around! LOL...
Well the proof is in the pudding so keep doing it and as long as you 
are fairly pain free, go with it... Sound like you have a good plan 
to work up to it... As for the broom thing, who knows... You could 
even make up some new &quot;cleaning your home&quot; moves that actually 

improve your body and serves as Spring cleaning!
Could be very productive! LOL...
It's funny that you mention the &quot;broom and water bottles&quot; 
thingamajig.
Take a look at Reinhards Shovelglove homepage (I think that's where 
it is, help Reinhard!)because before he thought of the Sledgehammer 
and sweater (I use a hand towel! LOL)
He had a Shovelglove &quot;Prototype&quot; which involved taped together 

water/sand filled bottles on a &quot;baton&quot; type thing....
I say, just take your broom and velcro an iron at the end so you can 
have a Shovelglove &quot;Cleanomatic 2000&quot;! You could even patent it! 

Again, back to your arm, think of the daily activities that you do 
with that arm... chances are you are using it more than you 
consciously realize... My right arm get's way more wear and tear 
than the left and is somewhat fixed in medial rotation... How did 
this happen? I use the computer, for, mmmmm, not that many hours a 
day, but the mouse does contribute to it... It finally occurred to 
me only fairly recently, that I use this arm for shifting in my 
car...
Having my hand on the stick shift and protracted (ie forward of the 
shoulder as opposed to resting at the side of your body) for nearly 
18 years now, has had it's impact on that shoulder... The gym, or 
some workout or some &quot;accident&quot; is always, in my opinion (with the 

exception of a direct impact from say a car accident or some object 
hitting you, or possibly a fall) the &quot;straw&quot; which breaks the 

proverbial &quot;camels back&quot;....
Have a great day!
Please feel free to sweep all the dust under a rug somewhere when 
you SG today :)
Love,
Deb
ps.. If you go to a good hardware store, they can fit you with a 
nice 36 inch handle on a 6 lb sledge head, if eight is too much...
The handle must weigh at least one pound!
That's only if you feel bored of sweeping the house :)

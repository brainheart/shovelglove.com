Hi Deb! My &quot;silly fat arm&quot; is no longer fat. But it is still silly, 

because a very small bit of stiffness still lingers and apparently 
will be with me indefinitely. :P However, I wanted to report that I 
did SG again last night - well, sort of. I used a broom :) Since 
that weighed so little, I slightly modified all the movements to 
involve my legs more - by doing something between a lunge and a 
squat on every rep. (otherwise, it would have been no workout at 
all.) It felt good on my legs, and nothing is sore today. I'm 
planning to do the broom a couple more times and then try switching 
to the sledge. After that, the plan is to (a) do the full 14 
minutes, but a LOT less reps, slower pace, and more rest in between 
reps; and (b) probably keep doing these modified movements so that 
my legs continue to be involved. The more weight I can shift from my 
arms to my legs, the better, at least at the beginning.

Feedback?

thanks,
Ariel

&gt; &gt; Hi Deb. So sorry to hear the job didn't work out. I hope you can 

&gt; &gt; find something better soon. Bad bosses can really make life 
&gt; &gt; miserable! 
&gt; ...Yep! It isn't my goal in life to ever have to go to a job that 

I 
&gt; don't look forward to being at.
&gt; Thanks Ms. Biffetybop!
&gt; How's your &quot;silly fat arm&quot; these days?
&gt; Hope you're better :)
&gt; Peace and Love,
&gt; Debster

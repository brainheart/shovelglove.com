Deb,

Way to go! I've still been shovelin along...just bad
about posting workouts. Churning butter is my favorite
drill..what's yours? Whereas sg is great i kinda miss
bashing an old tractor tire w/ my sledge it was great
for stress relief. I have been trying to spead the
word about sg esp to my friends who want to work out
but think they have to spend a bundle on gym fees (
that deters some people..(i know i prefered
kettlebells and privacy to Mulletheads at the local
gym) Well have a better one. 
Love, Peace and Chicken Grease :)

&gt; Today my arms were fairly tired (maybe because I
&gt; posted eighty times 
&gt; on NoS LOL :) I still did my duty! :)
&gt; Actually when you add SG to the 30 minute morning
&gt; circuit I have 
&gt; been doing for a week now it's just a bit more than
&gt; I am used to...
&gt; So I gave my poor shoulders a bit of a break and
&gt; tried to fool 
&gt; around with leg stuff and weird things like trying
&gt; to do &quot;toe ups&quot; 
&gt; with the SG... and Chest lifts with my ribcage,
&gt; while lying down... 
&gt; This really felt great because it also provided me
&gt; with some 
&gt; compression to tight chest muscles... Twelve pounds
&gt; of steel makes 
&gt; for an interesting self massager!
&gt; If you put it on your bellybutton, be prepared for
&gt; your pulse to 
&gt; explode into your neck, kindof like alien :)
&gt; Don't do it for long though as I think it kindof
&gt; screws up your 
&gt; blood pressure, especially don't do this if you have
&gt; high blood 
&gt; pressure already...
&gt; Who is around today in Shovelglove land?
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb :)
&gt;

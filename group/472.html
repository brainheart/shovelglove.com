Oh, I only walk like that for very brief periods when no one's watching, don't get 
the wrong impression! I passed the Thomas Test, so I guess my illiopsoas muscles are 
the right length. Hmmm, What could that tightness I get in my hips and lower back be? 
It doesn't happen all the time, but usually during periods of heavy work and lots of 
carrying. I can easily squat to rock bottom, so I wouldn't imagine it's a hip 
extensor problem, either. Trigger points? I dunno, I'm confused again...
The Pavel I reference is Pavel Tsatsouline. He is a Latvian-American strength/conditioning/flexibility 
guru. He uses &quot;Russian&quot; and &quot;Soviet&quot; in his ad copy. Good 
material though.
The 50# &quot;WarHammer&quot; is ridiculously overpriced (in fact, all sizes are!). I 
don't plan on buying one. However, if I can get a friend to fabricate one, that'd be 
pretty sweet. All in all, though, I'm not in a race to get it, seems like overkill 
for most applications.

&gt; One of the best stretches for your hip flexors you can do during 
your Urban Rangering (got this from Pavel). While keeping upright 
and moving, push your hips forward a bit. If you do this right, 
it doesn't screw up your walking,

.....But you might really look like a complete dork!!! LOL :)
It still beats sitting on your ass though :)

Pavel refers to this style of walking as leading with your belly or 
leading with your hips or something.

&quot;Captain, they put creatures in our ears!&quot;
Pavel? Who's that? I only know Pavel Chekov :)

He claims that this is really good for treating and preventing tight 
hips. Debbie, any opinions?

....Thanks Storm :) Of *course* I have an opinion on this, my pet 
hobby the body :)
In all seriousness there's really three issues to consider
1. Are your hip flexors tight and restricted to begin with? 
You shouldn't assume this automatically, unless you are a Catcher on 
a local softball team and you tend to stay in a very flexed position 
like that :) 

There are normal ranges of motion for all major muscles...That PNF 
book by Jeff Charland &quot;Facilitated Stretching&quot; is a very handy 

source for effective, passive isometric stretches, to be done with a 
partner, such as your wife, and self stretches.. Check it out some 
time next time you are thinking of adding something to your health 
library... It was the text I used in school for the class 
specifically on Sports Massage and Body Mobilization, it's really 
good :)

Generally the Illiopsoas muscles are what I like to refer to as 
the &quot;Treasure trove of trauma&quot; or &quot;Pandoras box&quot; muscles... When 
one 
is in a fight or flight situation, what primes us to blast out of a 
dangerous situation? The psoas... It is a muscle which also absorbs 
alot of tension if we stay in clenched positions alot or possibly 
have a bit too much of a lordosis in the low back (ie the typical 
beer belly or baby belly will create an exxageration of the lumbar 
curve) The bottom line is if the origin and insertion of the muscles 
are closer together for any lengthy period of time, this will 
positionally shorten the muscle length...and you will have a 
contracted area... To test your psoas, you would do a muscle length 
test called the &quot;Thomas&quot; test, in stretch literature and incase you 

are taking your State Boards :)
You have to lie on a table with your butt all the way to the edge.. 
If you want to test the length of the right psoas, you hold your 
left knee into your chest and lower the right leg.. If your psoas is 
short and restricted, then your leg, which in a normal range would 
be able to descend to the level of the table or a few inches below, 
will hover, slightly above table... What I like to refer to as 
a &quot;David Copperfield&quot; :)

2. Once you have done a muscle length check and feel stretching 
would be warranted, I just have to stick with my previous suggestion 
which is to do isolated static stretches...
Please, don't give up your walking regime on my account, but the 
likelyhood of you recruiting many more muscles while in motion will 
probably interfere with your desired outcome.. People tend 
to &quot;cheat&quot; on stretches ie: they create motion via leaning in when 

they should be upright and erect, they arch their backs etc... what 
happens there is that, yes motion is achieved in the direction of 
the stretch, but the muscle really isn't being stretched... Sorry 
that probably didn't make sense.. Just believe me. It's best to 
isolate the target muscle... I always do unilateral stretching and 
never past the elastic end point... Also, don't bounce... Another 
reason why I don't feel walking is really gonna stretch stuff out 
effectively...Maybe if you were really walking slow?
Slow gentle and consistent, and, after holding a position at your 
endpoint for around 20 seconds, always use your breath to deepen 
your stretch. Then hold it in the new position for another 20 
seconds...don't try to create massive change. You might only budge a 
few centimeters a day, but it adds up. This is my personal 
recommendation on the best way to get the muscles to lengthen....

3. When you don't stretch something's gonna tighten up, so I say, a 
little each day to keep it from sneaking up on you :)
Happy Stretching Stormboy!

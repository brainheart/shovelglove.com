Hi all :)
What an improvement over Maulstick Monday (ooh now that's a good 
one :)

I experimented with a wrist guard today...Not an ace bandage, it's 
the kind used for &quot;razor&quot; scooters to keep from breaking your wrist 

if you fall with your arms stretched out in front of you (those 
casualties of sport increased the emergency room attendance for kids 
under 12 by around 90% when the scooter hit the markets, all with 
Colles fracture,,,the wrist...)
So I didn't like this particular brace because there is actually a 
fork shaped piece of thick plastic interwoven into the bandage, 
which is supposed to take up the shock when a kid hits the pavement, 
and it got in the way of really gripping the SG handle...But I 
really felt alot better with that right side shovelling, so this is 
further encouraging me to buy a soft ace style wrist support...I'll 
probably only use it for a while anyway. Just that tiny extra 
support to keep from flopping around...
Also, I tried to do &quot;hoist&quot; a bit differently today..In addition to 

the one where you extend the elbow and lift the SG vertically (ps 
Reinhard I have a, hopefully helpful, comment on your arm position 
if you are interested, to even challenge your triceps more...let me 
know if you are curious :)
....I also tried to just &quot;hold&quot; the SG at &quot;half extension&quot; 
position, 
and see how long it took before my arm started to buckle and give 
in...Static holds are incredible for increasing strength, but not 
necessarily bulk ( I am bulky enough in this region of my body! But 
it's mostly alot of fat...Not for long!)
I made it to around 30 seconds.
I am feeling great about this whole thing :) The endorphins sure do 
help!
Reinhard...Again, you are a guy and you weren't nearly as overweight 
inch for inch as I am right now, but I can't help but be a little 
curious...When did you really start noticing your transformation 
from &quot;Mild Mannered Librarian&quot; to &quot;Mister Macho&quot; of the 
&quot;after&quot; 
picture :) I would have to venture a guess that this must have been 
a bunch of months in the making. Feel free to stay private on this 
if you would rather remain more mysterious :)
Peace,
Debbie

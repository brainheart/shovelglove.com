Ha ha! Well being around this group of &quot;workout artists&quot; has been 

very inspiring to say the least :) When I went into the repair shop 
yesterday to get my car inspected, I had a brilliant flash of 
inspiration, whilst gazing at the dumpster....
Tires! Mountains and mountains of tires waiting to find an adoptive 
parent who would abuse them! (sorry adoption parents out there. heh)
I am now the proud recipient of pickup truck tire which used to 
belong to a Dodge Ram extended cab pickup....
The name on the sidewalls of this rubber smashing block, I found to 
be very appropriate, considering I will be beating the living 
daylights out of it once the snow melts around here,,,,
&quot;Hercules&quot; LOL :)
So in honor of George Washington week, &quot;I cannot tell a lie&quot; I 

skipped Shovelglove yesterday... There's really no good reason for 
this so I plan on kicking my own ass today as penance...
However I did go shopping today and, I will say that I had quite a 
good little &quot;in store&quot; workout... It was one of those riduculously 

huge supermarkets, and I never go there... So I was wandering around 
lost like Mick Jones.... and it took some time to gather what I was 
looking for... I didn't use a cart and carried everything in a 
basket instead...Got some somewhat heavy items and by the end of the 
shop I would say the basket had to weigh 30 lbs, and the whole 
basket was buckling and seemed like it would separate from the metal 
handles! LOL :).... I was proud of my 
Shovelglove enhanced grocery carrying prowess!
LOL :) Maybe this one should be added to your everydaysystems eh 
Rein? You know a, grab whatever you can that's around and carry it 
for 14 minutes whenever an opportunity presents itself, kind of 
thing.. even if it's not in a sweater :) 
(That is unless they are cute!)
Cheers all :)
Warrior Deb,
Lifter of the Heavy cans 
and Large containers of Milk.... 
I will be doing my SG now though... Here I go :)

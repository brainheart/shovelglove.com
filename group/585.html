&gt; Deb - that is super awesome!!! (wow...I really sound like a valley 

&gt; girl online. I don't in real life, I promise!)

.....Like wow man you are soooo gnarly dude! :)

&gt; Another inch down. Way to go! Where did this inch come off?
.....Minor correction (clears throat...)
I am into the next inch space down... Technically it is only about 
an extra eighth of an inch! LOL.... But it's like when you diet and 
you plateau in a certain range like the 190's and then one magical 
day you hit 189.9!!!
My arms have lost a little over 2 inches of fat since I started in 
September, but I really have to attribute this progression to my 
more recent efforts since my new years resolution and creation of 
the Shovelglove Pact of Blood!
My stomach/waistline is down 3 inches, but keeps on teetertottering 
up and down a half inch... Time to fuel up my NoS efforts and do 
some more walking or something... My butt is looking better too 
since I added daily stairclimbing to my life... I try not to look at 
my butt too often, but heck, someone has to! LOL....


&gt; You are still inspiring me and making me impatient to &quot;graduate&quot; 

to the sledgehammer from the broom. I did the broom again last 
night and it felt good (of course, it wasn't much of a workout). I 
think I will use it maybe a couple more times and then move on to 
the heavy thing. VERY carefully this time! Have a great weekend!

.....Here's a great Taoist proverb...
&quot;The Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&quot;
Good luck with your broom!
If you want to try and make a cheap homemade SG which is a little 
lighter, why not try that thing I mentioned before... Take a medium 
sized empty coffee can, some cement mix and some medium length wood 
handle, and stick the thing into the cement...If you have cement 
around the garage or basement it's a cheap fix...Kind of like those 
Japanese &quot;stone clubs&quot; I saw somewhere, except with a Chock full of 

Nuts logo on the outside! LOL... I imagine that once it hardens it 
won't go flying off and probably will only weigh around 3 or 4 
pounds...
Love and Peace,
Deb :)

&gt; Gotta admit, the only Zen book I've ever read is the one about

I misused the word. My bad.

Hey Kevin, it ain't no biggie, props to you for using the word at 
all! Most people use the term having only a vague guess of what it 
means...In a really oversimplified nutshell, Zen consciousness is 
that spiritual state of true equanimaty. Not really trying to 
achieve something, just letting the process unfold, being at one 
with your task at hand. My best moments when I am doing a massage 
are these isolated moments when I am not &quot;doing&quot; it, but rather 

being so much in the moment that rather I am allowing the process to 
unfold, and not trying to impose myself or my will...I am letting 
the famous &quot;force&quot; of Star Wars fame, to flow through me.
The classic Japanese example, in archery, is to wonder whether the 
archer is shooting the target or is it the target hitting the archer?
The Pirsig book is a real fave of mine too, and does count, in some 
way as well...The main character's &quot;maintenence&quot; of all the little 

tuneups and repairs of his motorcycle, being such an extension of 
himself, is pretty Zen actually. Whatever you do in life can become 
a Zen experience, even mundane things, especially, such as digging a 
hole, doing the dishes, what have you. But the Japanese have 
cultivated ways of actually achieving this through the ritualized 
practice of certain arts, practice to the point where stuff 
just &quot;happens&quot;, without trying, totally automatically, and it is no 

longer possible to distinguish between the shot, the target, and the 
archer...*Trust* me, the book is much better than anything I could 
say on the topic. What is most interesting is to see how the author 
had to wrestle with letting go of so many Western preconceptions and 
un-do alot of stuff which was interfering with his real mastery, 
mainly his ego and his will...It was not easy for him to do and he 
narrates his journey through all of his &quot;successes&quot; and &quot;failures&quot; 

So go to the source, it's required reading :) I believe that you 
will enjoy it :)

Thanks for the tire info...I will let you know if I start doing it!

Again on Zen, there is a great quote from one of my favorite movies, 
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. It's the scene where the protagonist 
sword master, after years of studying meditation and martial arts, 
says during a fight sequence in which he is clearly in complete 
control:
&quot;Real Sharpness comes without effort&quot; 
Not to make too much of a stretch, but even our SG and Diet efforts 
made on a daily basis could be considered to be a very ritualized 
practice as well, eventually becoming largely unconscious in the end.

Chop wood, carry water, grasshopper&quot; :)
Peace,
Deb

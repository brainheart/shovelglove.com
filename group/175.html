Today on my lunch break, I visitted the local scrapyard, its just down the street 
from where I work. While rooting around for materials to make free-standing squat 
racks, I stumbled across something cool. At first, I thought it was a big clump of, 
well, who knows what, but it made me curious, and, after getting the gunk off it, I 
realized it was the head of a retired sledgehammer. It was big, too, although I 
wasn't sure how big. As much gunk as I scraped off the sledge, I couldn't read the 
weight. I guessed it would be worth it, just for having scrounged it. Well, since 
scrap steel is ten cents per pound, the guy let me have it (I have bought much stuff 
there before, and we have a good rapport). I cleaned it and weighed it, and, sure 
enough, it is a full-on 20# sledge! It is now in a nice hickory handle I purchased at 
work. It is an effing BEAR to handle. This is gonna be fun!

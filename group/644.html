Hi Nay, Deb,

This is why it's best to focus on &quot;days on habit&quot;
rather than pounds. Pounds are tricky things. But long
term they *will* come off if your habits are good.
There's no magic here. If you eat less and exercise
more you will lose weight. You are not some freak of
metabolism. It just takes time. I know it sounds too
obvious to be true, but trust me it is! 

If you want to worry about something, worry &quot;did I do
what I am supposed to do today, dietwise and exercise
wise?&quot; If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; relax and give it more
time. If the answer is &quot;well, not really, kinda
sorta,&quot; then make sure tomorrow goes better. Don't do
&quot;extra,&quot; just make sure to hit your daily (or
weekdaily) requirement. I don't think many people have
the problem of insufficiently strenuous workouts, or
insufficiently ruthless diet plans. I think most
people have the problem of un- or only sporadically
performed workouts and diet plans. It takes
surprisingly little, over time, to achieve huge
results. Have faith and do that little. And when the
doing is pleasurable (or at least tolerable), as I
find it is with shovelglove and no-s, it's really not that
bad.

Reinhard

&gt; Hi Nay, me again..
&gt; Quick ps... I was wrong, muscles actually weigh 
&gt; 3 times the amount inch per inch as fat...
&gt; So it really does make sense that you will get to a
&gt; crossroads as you 
&gt; get lower down in fat, where your pounds lost will
&gt; certainly start to 
&gt; be less relevant in relationship to the development
&gt; of a firm and 
&gt; strong new you...
&gt; Here's a quick link I found randomly on Google,
&gt; which explains &quot;Body 
&gt; composition&quot; pretty nicely...
&gt; Hope the link works.
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

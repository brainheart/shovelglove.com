Welcome, Art. As Deb says, don't worry about not doing
all the reps. As with any exercise routine, you're
going to have to start modest and build up. The
numbers I posted on the home page are what worked for
me at different stages. I have no idea how they'll
work for different people at their different stages,
and they don't take into account the weeks of
pre-routine diddling it took for me to get the
shovelglove concept down, which presumably
strengthened me up a bit. As a general rule, once you
get over the initial break in period, the only hard
parameter I'd recommend is to try to do the 14
minutes, even if it's very slow. But for now listen to
your jelly arms. If they won't cooperate, don't force
them. You'll be surprised how soon they get up to
snuff. 80% is better than 110% because 110% leads to
zero.

Funny looks are good. Better do a new crazy thing than
the crazy thing everyone else is doing. The new thing
may turn out to be not so crazy after all.

Do be careful! You can do things with a sledgehammer
that could easily land you in the emergency room or
america's funniest home videos (or both). Do the
movements with exaggerated slowness until you feel
very comfortable with them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Today I'll have my first workout. When I get
&gt; used to it, I'll 
&gt; &gt; probably start doing my workouts on a rebounder
&gt; (mini-trampoline) 
&gt; &gt; for extra effect.
&gt; &gt; ....Hitting it or jumping on it while
&gt; shovelglovving? You must be 
&gt; &gt; very coordinated, or have a Deathwish, LOL...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very UNcoordinated.. but I'll try it anyway.. I
&gt; was just talking about 
&gt; doing the chopping motions while on there, perhaps.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I did have my first &quot;workout&quot;, and my arms
&gt; feel like rubber. I didn't 
&gt; overdo it. I didn't do 14 minutes either. I didn't
&gt; do all the reps. I didn't 
&gt; want to overdo it. Overzealousness leads to injury.
&gt; Tomorrow's another day. I 
&gt; also learned to choke up (or is that down?) on the
&gt; handle.. already had my first 
&gt; end of the handle collision with the ceiling. That
&gt; (hopefully) won't happen 
&gt; again. My mom came in and thought I was nuts. I
&gt; explained what I was doing. She 
&gt; still thought I was nuts. Oh well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; PS. In my next to last post I lied about the 16
&gt; lbs, just use a 12, 
&gt; &gt; but Kevin I am *still* up for an
&gt; armwrestle!!!...But who 
&gt; &gt; knows...Maybe in a year or so...
&gt; &gt; Good Luck Al :)
&gt; 
&gt; It's &quot;Art&quot;, not Al. But thanks, anyway. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I went to one store, they wanted $40.00 for an 8
&gt; pounder! At the next store 
&gt; down the road, it was $21.99 for the 10 pounder I
&gt; bought. It's like, hey, I 
&gt; don't NEED a lifetime guarantee on the handle.. I'm
&gt; not going to hit anything 
&gt; with it (intentionally, anyway). They looked at me
&gt; like I was nuts. I get that 
&gt; look alot.

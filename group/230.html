Hi Shovelers :)
How's it going? I just had a nice little sg workout...I have to 
admit that it is not a habit yet and I wish it was because it always 
makes me feel good after and I really value it's effect on me...
Tried to do the &quot;hoist the sack&quot; with one arm, just to see how hard 

it would be...It's not happening any time soon...I don't know how 
you can do *that* one Reinhard! Two hands will do me fine for now, 
also I would hate to lose control of the sledge and have 
it &quot;massage&quot; my kidneys by accident.
Another thing I was wondering is, what time do you do the 14 minutes?
As soon as you get up, pre-shower, without any breakfast? Hmmm...I 
just don't want to make any more excuses to skip days, but (hey I'm 
making an excuse now...) when I have to get Richard off to school, I 
don't really enjoy the idea of having to do my SG while all 
the &quot;getting ready&quot; commotion is happening. Got any ideas on 

creating an &quot;inviolate&quot; time slot?
So here is a nice and pretty interesting view of the Abs which I dug 
up, from an article by a very famous &quot;Rolfer&quot; named Thomas 
Myers...He specializes in Myofascial pathways and wrote a book 
called &quot;Anatomy Trains&quot;, which likens the various stops along 

myofascial lines, to stops on a railroad line...
A couple of great views on the evolutionary function of our muscles.
The main point of interest for me, was that I never knew that the 
Transverse Abdominus actually attaches to the transverse spinal 
processes in the *back*...Hope you like it.

Heres the site, not sure if you will be able to just click this like 
a link?

Reinhard! I am *still* rolling in the aisles from that one!!!
You really have to write more blog for us :)
Hey! And what about that little line on your page where you say you 
will be posting a 2005, 6 , 7 etc.. photo eh? This time, no frying 
pan! Just both of your SG's at once!!! And don't forget what I told 
you last year.. If you need some more fun money, you might want to 
suppliment your work at MIT, or wherever you work, and go and show 
off your &quot;shovelglove induced musculature&quot; at Chippendales.. Oh 

wait, your wife might not like that :P
Funny your choice of words! I normally wouldn't think to 
say &quot;induced&quot;!!! That's really hilarious.
The last time I heard *that* word, I was being wheeled into the 
hospital and they were inducing me into LABOR!
48 hours of torture! Shovelglove is a cakewalk compared to 
childbirth! LOL 

Just about to start up the Shovelglove engines now.. So far my day 
started with my car being stuck in a muddy ditch, I couldn't budge 
it no matter how much shovelglove I have been doing, the angle of 
the car was too much...Wound up getting it winched out by the tow 
truck guy...
So far my day has been neither &quot;auto&quot; nor,,, well you can fill in 

the rest! LOL :)
Something tells me I may have too much serontonin floating around in 
me today! Heh heh :)

Keep On Swingin the Thing Guys!
Mathilda the Hun,
Cofounder of NY Chapter of Shovelglove
Pact of Blood

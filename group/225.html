Well, 
thanks for your concern. Actually, my calluses have come back due to easing back into 
training. I had let them get to be quite thick, which became a big problem in such a 
high-friction style of lifting (I was doing the lifts wrong, just learned that the 
unpleasant way.). For the amount of foolishness, I'm very glad the price wasn't 
higher. And no, I'm not one of those who &quot;likes pain&quot; I sometimes just 
don't feel the pain until after lifting. Most things that happen when I'm really gung 
ho can be fixed with ice, rest, stretching, massage, and/or chiro. This was a 
thankfully rare exception, and it could've been so much worse. One positive thing: 
Through the years doing various foolish things, I've learned a lot about healing and 
repair. Another positive thing: I don't usually keep making the same mistakes, except 
acumulating gadgets, implements, and other lifting stuff instead of kicking butt on 
what I've got.

Eeek! Sounds like kettle*yelling*, like as in yelling in agony!
Well I wanted a vicarious thrill and who else better to provide it 
than the Shovelglove groups official painiac,
Storm M Fox!
Is does kettlebelling usually involve self mutillation?
We want you to live to see 26, Storm, take it easy.
Be careful that your &quot;chunks&quot; don't turn septic. Ouch!

By Monday I will resume my sg, whether I have a cold or not. Just 
slowly. Have a nice weekend and stay out of the hospital!
Peace,
Deb

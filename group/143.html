Hey Rein, of course you are not sexist, just sexy LOL!
I appreciate your caring concern..
Don't worry about li'l ol me, I am not trying to please anyone else 
or do something I don't feel ready for...If you wind up thinking 
that I am Xena warrior princess, fine, it may be true! When I was in 
the hardware store, I took my time and *really* thought &quot;how does 

this feel?&quot; the 8 lb was just nothing, the ten was kindof wishy 
washy too...And I realize the 12 is alot, but I won't be doing all 
the moves you do. Just the ones I am ready for...I am not a &quot;Spazz&quot; 

and for two and a half years I have been doing the kind of work that 
requires regular practice of very precise and mindful 
movement...When I practice massage, I have to use my body to provide 
the power behind the stroke...so I won't be getting all my power 
from above and know how to stand so I don't strain my back...
Massage therapists who only work from the shoulder are the ones who 
develop carpal tunnel, and overuse tendinitis...Plus if you have to 
stand over a person for more than an hour at a time, and do a 
massage that doesn't feel like a wet napkin, you have to know about 
body mechanics..With me being 5'3&quot; I am often &quot;mismatched&quot; with some 

Amazon like creature of your size during a session...to provide 
power it's all about creating the right leverage...This is 
accomplished by different means: Table height, stepping back, 
leaning in and something which I will explain someday called &quot;Hara&quot; 

which is a Japanese term, which loosely translates as your &quot;Life&quot; or 

as Star Wars fans would say
&quot;The Force&quot;!
I have only once misread my bodies signs that I was doing something 
wrong for me, and as soon as I recognized that my table was one 
notch too low, I corrected it and voila, no more problem. Before 
that my low back was a bit sore post massage, and I knew it was just 
because of my body mechanics.
I will be doing a very slow workout, if I ever get up off my ass and 
away from this computer (LOL) and plan to wear supportive shoes and 
do a lot of &quot;lunging&quot; with my low body...The first time I ever went 

to a yoga class the teacher came up to me and said &quot;Are you sure you 

never did this before, you seem to have a complete understanding of 
what to do with your body as I call out the poses, and most people 
don't have that mind/body connection right away&quot;
It was from the training I received at school...Chi Gong exercises 
helped me develop this very strongly as well
If you want to know more on both the Hara and Chi Gong topics let me 
know...I will keep you posted, and don't worry my friend you will 
not have to send me flowers at the hospital this week!
Taking it slow and steady...(driving fence posts? Maybe in a year!)
May the force be with you :)
Love,
Deb

&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt; 
&gt; Not to be a crass sexist and reinforce the boy's
&gt; locker room ambiance, but 12 pounds might be a little
&gt; much. I started at 12 pounds but I'm kind of a big
&gt; dude, over six feet, and, as I was fond of pointing
&gt; out when I was fat, &quot;big boned.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, I'm thrilled to have a second(?)
&gt; member of the deadliest of the species in this group,
&gt; and I'd be delighted to be proved wrong -- just please
&gt; don't kill yourself trying to delight me.
&gt; 
&gt; Be careful, and keep us posted,
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard

&gt; &gt; I feel like I am in the boys locker room!
&gt; &gt; Without the &quot;fragrance&quot;
&gt; &gt; From the looks of the previous posts, with the
&gt; &gt; exceptions of some 
&gt; &gt; people named &quot;MT&quot; and the very mysterious &quot;D&quot;, 
this
&gt; &gt; group seems like 
&gt; &gt; its all menfolk...That's OK I was the only girl in
&gt; &gt; little league 
&gt; &gt; when I was nine. I stunk but it was fun to be around
&gt; &gt; all that 
&gt; &gt; testosterone :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I bought my sledge today. Tomorrow I will try it on
&gt; &gt; for size :)
&gt; &gt; 12 lb &quot;Collins Axe&quot; brand, made in Lewistown PA, USA
&gt; &gt; No yellow fiberglass for me thankyou very much. Wood
&gt; &gt; is good.
&gt; &gt; I am ready to bash up the world
&gt; &gt; Grrrrrrrrrr! LOL :)
&gt; &gt; I am very very psyched!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now where was that old sweater the moths liked so
&gt; &gt; much?
&gt; &gt; I have already decided on perfect shovelglove
&gt; &gt; music,,,,
&gt; &gt; Led Zeppelin I...Cranked up to 11 :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the hardware store today the guy behind me
&gt; &gt; stepped away from the 
&gt; &gt; counter when he saw me standing there waiting in
&gt; &gt; line...I think I'm 
&gt; &gt; enjoying that powerful feeling already
&gt; &gt; Supergirl Away!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I read the post where Rein talked about going up
&gt; &gt; from 12 to 16, and 
&gt; &gt; how the fact that the weight is on the end of a
&gt; &gt; stick makes a big 
&gt; &gt; difference in the force of the pull, well not
&gt; &gt; exactly those words. 
&gt; &gt; That is really true. When I compared just holding
&gt; &gt; them side by side, 
&gt; &gt; without swinging them around, it was very
&gt; &gt; noticeable. So I will 
&gt; &gt; probably just stick with 12 and I am sure it will
&gt; &gt; give me a doozie 
&gt; &gt; of a workout.
&gt; &gt; I am starting tomorrow morning. I think I will
&gt; &gt; develop my own 
&gt; &gt; routine, but, of course it will be 14 mins. Maybe
&gt; &gt; even try to make 
&gt; &gt; up some new moves :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I actually LIKE shovelling snow for real, as long as
&gt; &gt; I'm not in a 
&gt; &gt; hurry or something, but with SG the difference here
&gt; &gt; is the &quot;snow&quot; 
&gt; &gt; isn't gonna get tossed to the side and I'm going to
&gt; &gt; have to be much 
&gt; &gt; more careful about not jerking to an abrupt halt, or
&gt; &gt; flinging the 
&gt; &gt; damn thing through the wall.
&gt; &gt; This should really help me with self maintence/care
&gt; &gt; for my work, so 
&gt; &gt; it has an added very useful perk...For those of you
&gt; &gt; who haven't met 
&gt; &gt; me yet, I am a licensed massage therapist...My
&gt; &gt; forearms are already 
&gt; &gt; pretty strong, from all that massage, and I know all
&gt; &gt; about body 
&gt; &gt; mechanics, and leaning in, proper leverage, etc...
&gt; &gt; Oh and I have already made a safety modification to
&gt; &gt; the shovelling 
&gt; &gt; motion seen on Mr. E's video sample, which is to
&gt; &gt; grip the far end of 
&gt; &gt; the handle at the very end &quot;cupping it&quot; so to speak,
&gt; &gt; because this 
&gt; &gt; helps stabilize the whole thing during the &quot;tossing&quot;
&gt; &gt; phase of the 
&gt; &gt; movement, and the weight has a counter weight, or
&gt; &gt; force on the end 
&gt; &gt; of the stick. If this is cheating somewhat, so be
&gt; &gt; it. It's all 
&gt; &gt; about leverage folks, leverage and balance.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, arms are pretty strong already, but one thing I
&gt; &gt; really don't 
&gt; &gt; exercise is my stomach, and low back. And boys (and
&gt; &gt; women if you are 
&gt; &gt; there, give a holler) let me tell you, when one
&gt; &gt; gives birth to an 
&gt; &gt; 11lb, baby, and have gained as much as I have, going
&gt; &gt; up and down 
&gt; &gt; repeatedly, over the last 10 years (lowest around
&gt; &gt; 160, highest 215) 
&gt; &gt; that mid section takes on a very flabby life of it's
&gt; &gt; own...I 
&gt; &gt; absolutely abhor situps so I really hope that SG
&gt; &gt; helps get rid of 
&gt; &gt; this kangaroo pouch.
&gt; &gt; PS I will try to make my future posts here at SG
&gt; &gt; central,less 
&gt; &gt; lengthy, as it will interfere with my allotted SG
&gt; &gt; time, and just 
&gt; &gt; give me another bad reason to sit on my ass.
&gt; &gt; Wish me luck, and good luck to all you shovelling
&gt; &gt; fools :)
&gt; &gt; Peace and Grunting,
&gt; &gt; Debbie
&gt; &gt; If I am not back after 14 minutes send help :)

&gt; *CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP* Congrats Deb!!!!
....Thank you very much Ariel :)

&gt;Your results are really inspiring to me.
....Thanks again :) I think the driving force for me in doing this 
is that it's usually fun. When I'm tired I do a very &quot;take it easy&quot; 

approach. I like to make up my own moves and get creative...
You know, imagining I'm the next Michelle Yeoh from Crouching 
Dragon :) Who knows? Maybe if I keep this up a few more years I 
will be! LOL, but then I'll have to learn how to handle a sword too!

&gt;And impressive...going up to 16 lbs, holy crap. I can't imagine 
ever being able to do that.
.... I think those were almost my exact words verbatim when I found 
out that Reinhard had a 16 lb one, and then when I found out that 
Richard and Storm have 20 lb hammers I really said holy &quot;beep&quot; 
:)
I didn't get it yet, because unfortunately, the hardware store has 
to order it.. the guy who does the ordering from ACE hardware will 
be there tomorrow and they said it would come by Thursday... But I 
don't wan't no yellow fiberglass handle, so who knows, I might have 
to make a few more calls... I also don't want to spend more than 
say 25 bucks or 30 max... Any suggestions as to countrywide hardware 
outlets which would carry a 20 lb one? Lowes? Home Depot?
I'll find something :)

&gt; Maybe someday. You are not helping my impatience to try this 
again :)
....Good! You can do it again, but just keep it to a shorter time 
and watch out for pain... Pain is natures way of warning us.. If we 
don't listen, nature just turns up the volume until we do...
As for tendonitis, circular ice massage gets that real good...
I actually had a little problem with right handed shovelling because 
my wrist was weak and it would instigate some pain... but I kept it 
up and my arm is completely rehabilitated... And that's a big deal 
for me because I really injured my shoulder when I was in between 
semesters at school, lifting a very heavy speaker cabinet to a bar 
where I had a music gig... Unfortunately I had no personal roadies!
Well after several flights of stairs, and a 50'ish pound amp yanking 
the heck out of my shoulder... Not only did I tear my supraspinatus 
(rotator cuff above the scapula) I also did some major damage to my 
rhomboids and longissimus erector muscle (back erectors) and 
dislocated a few ribs... I had to go through 9 or 10 months of 
unabating pain and my arm atrophied because I had something called 
Thoracic Outlet Syndrome... Somehow I made it through school and got 
my license, but there were moments that I was sure my career was 
over before it started... I thank God very often that my therapist 
Gary Lee, an Ortho-Bionomy practitioner, was kind enough to help me.
My school had a bizarre policy about teachers giving their students 
evaluations and treating them.. I suppose it was probably all about 
their insurance coverage, since they had to have every little thing 
supervised etc... Strange, in a healing enviornment how only one guy 
was willing to put himself &quot;out&quot; by simply placing his hand on my 

shoulder and back and asking me to breathe... For about 5 or 6 
months I couldn't get one person to help me!...
Well, if you still swell up when you work out, definitely don't do 
it till you figure out why...but I'd say, don't be too worried... 
Just don't go ballistic and build up slow...Now I'm fine with all 
movements but in the beginning, when I'd get those &quot;twinges&quot; I'd 

just avoid the painful moves and watched that I kept my wrists in as 
much of a neutral position as I could... 

&gt;Hope you have a great weekend! (and a peaceful one, with less 
emotional trauma)-Ariel
... I feel great today, thanks! Hope you have a peaceful weekend as 
well :)
Love,
Deb

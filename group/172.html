&gt; Well, I did get a sledgehammer yesterday. My husband's was just 
too 
&gt; heavy. I only got an 8 lb one and for me it is heavy. WOW. It 
was 
&gt; hard. By the end I was going so slow. I started before I got the 
&gt; hammer with an empty cue stick case. That was way too easy but it 

&gt; gave me practice with the motions. Now that I have the hammer, 
what 
&gt; a difference the workout is. 

Hey Lee :)
YOU GO GIRL! Wonderwoman!
The first time I did it I really felt it too...Who would have 
guessed? Major metabolic challenge to the body... The second time 
was much more comfortable, and I had to wait a full day and a half 
till my soreness had resolved and I was ready for the next session.
What did your husband say when you told him you were headed to the 
hardware store to buy a sledge? Did he look worried? LOL!
Have a great time wielding your shovel :)
Love Deb

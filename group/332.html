&gt; Wow.. the most I've ever weighed was around 220 (and I'm 6'3&quot;!) 

So, um, yeah. 
....Yes I was a globular maternity massive mom :) My son was 11 
lbs :) It was the gestational diabetes I had...
You are a lanky dude!

&gt; but I am incorporating more raw foods into my diet, so that ought 

to help. ALOT.
....Yes I noticed that all your links are to rawfooders...Kudos if 
this helps, I couldn't do it 100% what with all that dehydrating 
stuff! LOL But you've gotta love those enzymes :)
&gt; 
&gt; (I'm a weekday warrior, too. Being self-employed and living at 
home with Mom gives me all this wonderful extra time!)

....ooh sounds familiar :) 
What do you employ yourself as? :)

&gt; LOL.. today's selection was Vengeance Rising, a defunct Christian 

metal band. Heavy metal really gets me pumping. :)

.....On &quot;The Return of Spinal Tap&quot; the bassist Derek Smalls (Harry 

Shearer)talks about his short lived music experience outside 
of &quot;Tap&quot; with a Christian rock band called,,,,
&quot;Lambs Blood&quot; LOL,,, I think the lyrics on the homevideo were 

something something &quot;your soul will burn...&quot; LOL! It was so funny 
:)

&gt; SG is definitely better with music, though. Then again, so is 
walking, though I did without the other day, because I just wanted 
to get out and get it done while it was still light out. If I took 
the time to look through my stuff for a CD player, headphones, 
batteries, CDs, etc., I never would have made it out on time. 
Though, I have a feeling, the right music will prompt me to walk 
faster. :)

....Yes I like to have tunes on when I walk for exercise, but 
sometimes it's nice just to listen to nature when I am just 
meandering on slow speed (which is most of the time! LOL!)

Good luck with your Rawfooding, you know, you can still be a 
rawfooder and a NoS'ser at the same time... NoS is mostly about good 
habits, it might even enhance rawfooding :) Unless you are getting 
all your calories from raw sugar canes! :)
Peace and Sneezing,
Deb

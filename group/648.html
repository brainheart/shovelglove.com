You've been at this since August and have lost 42 pounds???

Congratulations!

But if you keep up your current progress, you'll be at 130 in, let's 
see, 40 pounds in 8 months is five pounds a month... only about three 
more months!!!

You're my idol. You're a weight loss star. I'm truly, truly 
impressed. I hope you feel as great about your weight loss as I feel 
inspired by it.

By the way, if you're well musculed, the charts will skew light. 
Maybe 138 or 140 is as light as you'll ever be.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks guys for the tips and encouragement. I guess I am having 
&gt; mental blocks. When I started this journey back in August of last 

&gt; year, I weight 191 pounds and looked like a stuff polish sausage!
&gt; 
&gt; I have been taking measurements, because I knew that this tricky 
&gt; correlation existed. I also have taken before pictures, and 
progress 
&gt; pictures. I SEE the difference.
&gt; 
&gt; So I am down to 149. And that is still, according to every chart, 

&gt; doctor and whatever, not really a healthy weight for me. And I 
felt 
&gt; my best when I was around 130. So that's what I am aiming for.
&gt; 
&gt; Will the body eventually catch up then? I mean, I don't think I'll 

&gt; ever have so much muscle that it'd be reasonable to weight 150 and 

be 
&gt; fit?
&gt; 
&gt; Or is there some test for body fat and this and that, which can 
tell 
&gt; me, based on my muscle and bone size - what is a good, reasonable 

and 
&gt; muscled weight to set out for, that'd solve a lot for me.

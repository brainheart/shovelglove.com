Debbie, you are doing most excellent. I am still on track, but haven't 
shov=
elgloved yet today. For me the hardest part is just starting. I have a 
kit=
chen timer I set for 14 minutes 30 seconds. I figure I use 30 seconds to 
st=
art the timer and pick up the sg. This way I feel that I have done an honor=
able 14 minutes.
=20
I am going to keep Swednesdays and one other S day, but need to plan it 
ahe=
ad of time and will post the days I am doing this.=20
=20
Great work,
Joe.=20

But in all honesty I had two, semi demanding massages today and was=20
pretty pooped... by about 10 minutes in I almost did a &quot;Reinhard&quot;=20

Not interested in &quot;poking out my eye&quot; (sounds of mothers nudgy

Tired guys... tomorrow will be shovelglove break, and since I have=20

Kevin...when you do squat thrusts you can put the sg on your, for a=20

hold it in place at neck level so it doesn't slide off...
It serves as both a level for your back, and extra added resistance=20

Good night
Deb

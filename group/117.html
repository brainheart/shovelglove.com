Oh. I remember that stress. I remember being terrified when we put 
her in a car seat to take her home - she was so little, it just 
didn't seem right.

Now she's a 13 year old, 5'7&quot; hard-as-twisted-blue-steel black belt 

that doesn't give us a minute's peace(and the music! Those rockers 
are so angry!).

The second child is much less stressful. He's 10 already, so maybe 
it's just my memory fading. :0)

The very best of luck to you and your family. I like to avoid 
cliches, but it's the hardest job you'll ever love.

&gt; Thanks, Kevin. It's mostly good stress at this point.
&gt; Wife and baby are doing fine. And please, all,
&gt; continue to post. I may not find time over the next
&gt; few weeks to concoct major innovations myself, but I
&gt; look forward to reading about some. And they don't
&gt; have to be &quot;major.&quot; &quot;Hi&quot;s and &quot;here's my 
routine&quot;s
&gt; are, as always, very welcome.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've got a bit going on right now, and diet and
&gt; &gt; &gt; exercise are pretty low priorities. Mornings (my
&gt; &gt; usual
&gt; &gt; &gt; shovelglove time) are now out (I've got to urban
&gt; &gt; &gt; ranger over to the hospital before work), but I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; been squeezing my routine in evenings -- barely,
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; hey, I'm told sleep deprivation burns a ton of
&gt; &gt; &gt; calories. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 14 minute bit really helps. I've been very
&gt; &gt; tempted
&gt; &gt; &gt; to skip days these last couple of weeks, but only
&gt; &gt; &gt; missed one (plus 1 new, and very legitimate,
&gt; &gt; s-day).
&gt; &gt; &gt; As magnificently buff as routines twice as long
&gt; &gt; might
&gt; &gt; &gt; get me, there's no way I'd be able to keep them up
&gt; &gt; &gt; during times like these. Yes, I could adjust, and
&gt; &gt; go
&gt; &gt; &gt; from 14 minutes to half an hour or more depending
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; stress levels, but habit is a funny creature; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; fussy about adjustments; it tends to get offended
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; just split.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So hurrah for 14 minutes, and so far so good.

I picked up another good 20 pounder at a pawn shop
cheap, several of them deal in tools, just a
suggestion for after the important bills are paid.
Also alot of workmen swear by fiberglass sledges...its
the durability factor.

&gt; Okay, this was a bit of a wild goose chase tonight
&gt; :)
&gt; In anxious anticipation, I felt like trying out a 16
&gt; lb one tonight 
&gt; and Richard wanted to try out the 8 lb one!
&gt; Well we had fun... First had a night out which was
&gt; lots of fun at 
&gt; some chain family restaurant with decadent desserts
&gt; and lots of 
&gt; tiffany lamps and crap all over the walls...
&gt; Then we got to Lowes. Lord help me not go and give a
&gt; whooping to the 
&gt; customer service guy on the phone who told me they
&gt; had 16 lb 
&gt; ones...because all they had were 8 lb ones! LOL. We
&gt; had to drive in 
&gt; traffic and smog about 20 minutes to get there for
&gt; that!
&gt; Then we found our way to Home Depot and they did
&gt; have them, but with 
&gt; those fiberglass handles with a rubber sleeve near
&gt; the head.. Yuck!
&gt; Somehow that handle just seems slippery and just
&gt; feels all wrong to 
&gt; me, so I'm going to just order another one from my
&gt; local 
&gt; lumber/hardware store in town here, with a wood
&gt; handle...
&gt; But we spent about 14 minutes trying them all out in
&gt; the store and 
&gt; actually did about 5 good minutes of exercise if you
&gt; don't count the 
&gt; part where we knocked all the axes and mauls and
&gt; rakes and shovels 
&gt; off the wall! (just kidding :)
&gt; Seriously, we were doing shovelglove in the aisle of
&gt; the 
&gt; store...Richie tryed the 8, the 4 and the 3 lbs ones
&gt; and I used the 
&gt; 16 lb one... Well, I am psyched to get my own, but
&gt; when we left the 
&gt; stores and headed home, I realized that my
&gt; priorities should be to 
&gt; fix my cars exhaust first... That is just too
&gt; dangerous to put off 
&gt; any longer... Those fumes are pretty awful.. But I
&gt; am definitely 
&gt; into the upgrade once the car's fixed up...Let me
&gt; tell you my hands 
&gt; and back were LOVING IT!.... A few couples kept
&gt; passing us looking 
&gt; with total confusion and dismay. It was funny :) At
&gt; this point for 
&gt; me, that eight pound one was like a teaspoon!
&gt; LOL...I tried to do a 
&gt; couple of one handed hoist the sacks, and after
&gt; about 2 my arm 
&gt; said &quot;Going up? I don't think so!&quot; LOL
&gt; Well we still had a great time and Richie had his
&gt; first session of 
&gt; Shovelglove... He has already developed a move here
&gt; at home with my 
&gt; 12'er... It's more like shovelglove &quot;shuffleboard&quot;
&gt; :)
&gt; He just pushes the thing back and forth like he is
&gt; pushing a broom! 
&gt; LOL.. I'm gonna get him his own soon, he did great..
&gt; but he did 
&gt; say &quot;My arms are dead!&quot; when we got out to the
&gt; parking lot :)
&gt; Boy I can just imagine how much more of a workout
&gt; that 4 lbs extra 
&gt; is going to give me... I can't wait... Must make
&gt; more money soon...
&gt; Have a great weekend guys!
&gt; 
&gt; Now for that guy who works at Lowes.....grrrrrr
&gt; LOL
&gt; Long live the alliance!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb
&gt;

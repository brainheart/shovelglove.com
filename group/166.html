Hi John,

&quot;Stoke the oven&quot; was a relatively late movement, I'd
beefed myself up considerably before even starting it,
so I can't vouch for its beginner-friendliness.

My basic policy on stuff that hurts, which has served
me well over that last few years, is:

1) if it's not just soreness, take the next day off

2) if it persists, stop doing the movement under
suspicion or cut down the reps. If you're not sure
which movement is the culprit, experiment until you've
nailed it. Don't force yourself to persist in a
painful movement because you like the idea of it. You
can always come back to it later when you're stronger
and try again.

As a result of this policy (or just dumb luck), I've
never had anything hurt more than a day and rarely
even that.

Case in point: I posted a while ago that I'd stopped
doing &quot;chop the tree&quot; and &quot;the fireman&quot; regularly
because of real or imagined back strain. I'm doing
them again now pretty much every day, just fewer reps,
and nice and slow. Am I stronger now, or just more
careful? Probably a bit of both.

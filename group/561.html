Hey all :)
Check it out... I was doing the Lasso with only one hand tonight... 
Both sides...it was actually easier than with two, since you don't 
have your thumbs banging together... This definitely requires you to 
grasp firmly or smash everything within a 10 foot diameter...
I hope that little old lady is in tomorrow so I can see if she will 
donate her sledge to a worthy cause...

Well just as an update on my occupational hazzards theory, I always 
use with my clients who think they hurt themselves &quot;at the gym&quot; but 

can't imagine that it's really their desk/computer whatever, type 
job which is really doing them in... the gym is what I like to refer 
to as the &quot;straw that broke the camels back&quot;.... The stuff we do in 

our daily activities has much more weight when it comes to our 
postural health and the happiness of our musculoskeletal system... 
I have been at this pt aide position and I do about 10 mini massages 
a morning, on these very low chiropractic tables... also, I get hot 
packs and put on electric stimulation for the patients... Anyway...I 
have never ever had a problem with my back or neck before, in my 
three years of doing massage (that includes school) and in merely 
one and a half weeks of stooping over tables and having to look down 
alot because, those hot packs are hot, and you can't really make 
them without some looking down at the table, my neck is completely 
uncomfortable and unhappy! In my office I have the table height 
right for me and if a client is a bit large, I lower it, and raise 
it if they are really little... I often work without even opening my 
eyes and just do what feels right... Shovelglove has never hurt me, 
massage has never hurt me.... I've been great,,up till now! I'm in 
an enviornment which isn't encouraging good body mechanics... So 
this is my challenge for tomorrow, and I plan on getting an 
adjustment from Robert if he has time as well: I have to figure out 
how I can make hot packs without looking down, and also, give 
massages without having to bend so much and look down... Maybe I'll 
just sit on people!
Have a great day!
Peace,
Deb :)
PS.. I wrote to Mistress Krista, from Stumptuous...she seems great! 
Says she loves shovelglove and was happy to hear that I am doing 
it... Then she said, in regard to Massage Therapists, &quot;my butt is 

thankful for your existence&quot; LOL :)
I told her to tell her posterior &quot;You're very welcome&quot; :)

K... I pound a tire as part of my workout, as well as 
&gt; shovelgloving. 
D....Hi Kevin :)
I think I would like to try this sometime!...Does the tire absorb 
the shock of hitting it full on? I'm sure there is some rebound too. 
I guess I'm concerned not to traumatize my wrists or shoulder, since 
they are my bread and butter and tools of my trade...But I must 
admit, this sound like alot of fun, maybe a nice way to let off 
steam. Fill me in on this please. Of course my neighbors will 
probably raise their eyebrows, but I could always do it in the 
garage.

K... Doing real work is another thing again. It's definitely harder 
to dig a hole than it is to shovelglove. That said, it's much 
easier to dig a hole now that I've been shovelgloving. It's all the 
distracting, non-Zen, aspects of digging a real hole (dirt, rocks, 
roots) that make it harder.
D...Actually Kevin, digging a hole sounds very Zen to me :) I 
suggest you run out and buy a copy of the Eastern Philosophy 
Classic, &quot;Zen in the Art of Archery&quot;, by German Philosopher Eugen 

Herrigel...I think you might like it. It's only about 100 pages or 
so. He spent 6 years studying Archery (one of the Zen arts of Japan, 
along with Flower Arrangement, which his wife took up) with one of 
the great Masters, and this is his description of learning about 
achieving a state of Zen through this ritualized sport. I loved it!
If you dig enough holes and rocks and roots, and keep coming back to 
the same task over and over, in a very deliberate &quot;digging&quot; ritual 

you will get to the point where you are no longer struggling with 
the task, you will experience a level of Zen consciousness, which, 
paradoxically, is very un &quot;conscious&quot;...But this may take years to 

do so unless you are *really* into landscaping the same 3 square 
feet for a long time, it may feel very Non Zen :)
You are an inspiration!
Deb

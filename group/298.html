...No, actually I recycled this one from Reinhards brother's 
original post on the first page of shovelglove group posts... I had 
heard that news about the &quot;Bowflex&quot; recall, bad news for them, to be 

sure, see you later company in Chapter 11 land... I had remembered 
that Obtuse wrote something about Bowflex, so I brought it back as a 
segway to the latest news on the now defunct, contraption.
Hey thanks for the ideas on flipping tires, that sounds really 
great. When I actually used the shovelglove for hitting a hard 
surface, ie a metal scale, I actually noticed that my hands hurt 
after, and my forearms were workin' too, and pretty tight that 
evening...Does the tire do that to you? I guess any exercise that 
you build up to gradually, is going to be ok...Yesterday was far 
from &quot;gradual&quot;...It was a massacre on technological tyranny!
But I couldn't do it very often because I would totally ruin my 
hands.
So, Kevin, now that I know you flip tires, and *manly* truck ones at 
that, I am even more stoked about our little &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; 

and I think I will have to visit a junkyard soon! What's your record 
so far...I will beat it! LOL
Hasta la vista baby! :)
Deb

Yes, people tend to look funny when you order a sledge
above 12lb, the nice little old lady clerk at &quot;True
Value hardware&quot; actually said &quot;What the hell you want
that for?&quot; when i ordered my 20lb sledge. I've always
done 2 minutes under hot water then 2 minutes under
cold water in a shower as a follow up to a good
workout. But sometimes good old Epsom salts take the
soreness out real good Lol. Yeah going to the gym can
be a real pain in so may ways...SG workouts are
great...some people do have more of a problem
self-motivating, in the case of friends of mine whom i
tell about SG, they claim they ae tired of driving to
the gym, waiting for machines/benches, walking around
people who are supposed to be working out but are
really chatting each other up,,Etc,. I ask &quot;why go why
not try SG or a good calisthenic workout or buy
dumbells? invariably the response i get is &quot;Well im
more motivated to exercise if more people are there
and i dont want to feel i'v wasted the gym fee. YEESH!

Sorry for the rant but the gym scene just gets me
down..I'll stick w/ home workouts.

&gt; Hey guys, last week I was going to the gym and all
&gt; gung ho! Then my 
&gt; son got a cold on Friday and had glands the size of
&gt; brazil nuts so we 
&gt; pretty much stayed in from Friday through
&gt; Monday...Guess what? 
&gt; Between the little lag time, and the fact that I
&gt; have been making 
&gt; calls and searching the want ads for some job, since
&gt; massage is slow 
&gt; going to develop,,,slow I tell you!, I stopped going
&gt; to the little 
&gt; gym.... Okay, I was all stoked to go there four
&gt; times a week and now 
&gt; I'm like &quot;Bleep&quot; it! LOL...So I guess Reinhard, your
&gt; SG psychology 
&gt; of &quot;yo yo gym hopping&quot; is right on target, damn your
&gt; theory! LOL
&gt; But thank you from the bottom of my biceps
&gt; brachialis and the top of 
&gt; my teres minor, for thinking this home workout up! 
&gt; I still haven't 
&gt; flung the &quot;widower maker&quot; around today yet, because
&gt; I was up 
&gt; *again*!!!! pre 6 am!!! I think I turned into a
&gt; groundhog or 
&gt; something! Well it's still better than Winter,
&gt; that's for damn sure.
&gt; I was shocked at how quickly I fizzled out as far as
&gt; my motivation to 
&gt; go to the gym, simply because I had to &quot;go to&quot;
&gt; it....Once I'm there 
&gt; it's great, but it's the getting going that takes a
&gt; herculean mental 
&gt; effort! That's not to say I won't go back sometime,
&gt; but there's no 
&gt; way I will ever be able to utter the words &quot;well
&gt; looks like I won't 
&gt; be home today so no SG for me&quot; because I live
&gt; there!!! LOL
&gt; Oh well, one task at a time...right? :) So I guess
&gt; when one is 
&gt; having a &quot;motivational crisis&quot; SG is really the
&gt; perfect answer...It's 
&gt; there, you're there, so get going! :) Some more
&gt; sblog and I'm off 
&gt; again,,,
&gt; I went to the hardware store, both to see if they
&gt; would hire me to 
&gt; do whatever... they have a lumberyard too and I
&gt; thought maybe they 
&gt; could hire me as a stock person or something, since
&gt; desperate times 
&gt; call for desperate measures, and to see whether they
&gt; had a 16 lb 
&gt; sledge to tinker with and imagine using in my daily
&gt; routine...No such 
&gt; luck... Only went up to 12... When I asked the guy
&gt; if they had 
&gt; anything heavier, I kid you not, his eyes popped out
&gt; of his head and 
&gt; his mouth just hung agape as he said &quot;Heavier???&quot; 
&gt; LOL... 
&gt; I think tonight I will ice my forearms since they
&gt; are getting 
&gt; pretty &quot;ouchie&quot;...that's a great way to flush out
&gt; congested muscles...
&gt; Anyone else here ever try ice? I like to use it
&gt; when I take a shower 
&gt; so I can 1. Not drip all over the place when the ice
&gt; melts 2. Do 
&gt; contrast bathing and alternate hot shower water with
&gt; circular ice 
&gt; massage... This method is great for refreshing tired
&gt; muscles...It 
&gt; pumps all the crap out....but that first minute or
&gt; two of ice does 
&gt; tend to make you scream like a baby....
&gt; Yours,
&gt; Debbie &quot;yo-yo&quot; Feder

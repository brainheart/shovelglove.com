Hi all, sorry I've been absent a few days. Just wanted to check in 
and let you know I did my 3rd pseudo-shovelglove last night (with 
the unweighted broom) and I am switching to the hammer tonight. My 
plan is to go very VERY slow and focus more on my form than anything 
else. The shoveling motion in particular still feels very awkward to 
me and I'd like to make sure I'm finding the most &quot;natural&quot; way 

possible to do it. Anyway, my arms are still fine (of course - 
they've been lifting a broom which probably weighs about half a 
pound ;) and my legs are just a little sore from all the 
squatting/lunging I've been putting into every movement. But this is 
the normal kind of soreness, nothing like what I had before.

NOTE to Renee: first, welcome! (from a true veteran of this group - 
I've been here, oh, almost 3 weeks now! :) Second, I know you 
probably already did your first SG last night, but please please 
please listen to what Reinhard said about starting slow. I can't 
agree with that enough. I did my first SG with an 8 lb hammer on 
March 11. I went at it with great enthusiasm (well, at least great 
stubbornness) for 14 minutes, and spent the next week and a half 
recovering. My arms were VERY unhappy. So I hope you exercised more 
caution last night.

wish me luck tonight - 
Ariel

Hi Debbie! Thanks for the welcome! I'm seriously thinking of going 
to Home Depot this evening. Do they have a good selection of 
sledgehammers? anyone know? I'm guessing I should start w/an 8 lb. 
one since I have so little upper body strength - Deb, what's your 
female perspective on this?

&gt; ....Hey Ariel! I wanted to welcome you to our group...
&gt; I agree with you that Reinhard is really a breath of fresh air!
&gt; Truly &quot;Inspirational&quot; :)
&gt; Go and check out your hardware store sister... I need some 
homegirls 
&gt; here to keep me company. If you are really out of shape, give 
&gt; yourself some time and patience to adjust to using the SG and make 

&gt; sure you pick some really great tunes and imagery to utilize..
&gt; It just makes things so much more fun that way! I took about 
three 
&gt; months to finally commit to doing SG 5 days a week... but I did 
work 
&gt; up to it slowly, but surely... There were some weeks last year 
which 
&gt; I only had 2 workouts to show for, but this is such a fun exercise 

&gt; and it really makes you feel like a million to do it... So don't 
set 
&gt; your sights on &quot;Failing miserably!&quot; okay :)
&gt; Meanwhile, instead of having dust collect on the SG, you can use 
&gt; it's fuzzy end to dust your counters as you swing all around the 
&gt; room.. Some kind of domestic martial art dusting ritual!
&gt; Seriously, this Stumptuous lady sounds like a real gas and I am 
&gt; happy cool people are starting to know about a very cool activity!
&gt; Keep us posted!
&gt; Peace and Love,
&gt; Deb

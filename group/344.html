LOL...
Hey if I'm gonna post I might as well amuse myself!
I shoveled our first snow of the season and wondered,how it would 
feel, now that I've been &quot;pumping SG&quot; LOL...
Well, at least in this respect, size does matter... My shovel had an 
insufficiently long handle and even being the &quot;shorty&quot; that I am, 

5'4&quot;?, I found myself, all too often, having to shovel from a 
stooped position, which, I'm sure you all know, causes &quot;back ouchies&quot;
There wasn't too much weight involved, as we only had a couple of 
inches, but I kept thinking &quot;My kingdom for a longer lever!&quot;, 

because the bending was enough to make me uncomfortable....
But it was fun to be doing some moving around out in the fresh and 
very chilly air...
I still did my SG today, since the shoveling didn't really do the 
trick in the aerobics department with such a small amount of snow on 
the shovel...It felt great today, and my &quot;arms of flab&quot; are going to 

look real different sometime in the near future!
Okay, so who, besides Reinhard, has been keeping up with SG? Speak 
now or have your &quot;oven stoked&quot; LOL
Did you all go away to another Shovelglove website? LOL...
Who's still around? :)
Love,
Deb

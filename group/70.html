Allan,

&quot;Scenario based shovelglove&quot; is something that
definitely needs to make it to the homepage. It's
hilarious. It's inspiring. And you got the whole
family into it. I had no idea they even made 4 pound
sledges. Not just does it sound like a ridiculous
amount of fun, but what an engine for coming up with
new moves. And as for sustaining interest, what could
beat cycling through different (ideally 5, I guess)
scenarios? Please post the details of any other
scenarios you come up with. I think I'm going to have
to give this a shot myself...

Thank you!

Reinhard

&gt; I wanted to share my first attempt at a shovelglove
&gt; workout with everyone. The post may run long, hope
&gt; you
&gt; don't mind. 
&gt; 
&gt; First let me say I bought a 10 lb and an 8 lb
&gt; sledge.
&gt; I have a 17 and an 11 year old son who want to do
&gt; this
&gt; with me. They had no 12 lb at Home Depot. The 10 is
&gt; right for me and my teenager, I need to get a
&gt; smaller,
&gt; 4 lb for my 11 year old. Just in case you are going
&gt; to
&gt; get your kids involved, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; And a quick note - I did my workout outside,
&gt; neighbors
&gt; be damned. It was 95* outside and the sun was high,
&gt; I
&gt; figure they had to work in the heat in the old days,
&gt; I
&gt; will try it, too!
&gt; 
&gt; To the workout: 
&gt; _____________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to base the workout on a scenario. I
&gt; called
&gt; it &quot;preparing the defenses.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; First, I had to &quot;clear the land,&quot; better known as
&gt; mowing the lawn for you mundanes. You can skip this
&gt; part if your castle or village does not have a
&gt; prairie.
&gt; 
&gt; Next was to &quot;dig the moat.&quot; This consisted of
&gt; shoveling over each shoulder 10x, to each side 10x,
&gt; and to the front 10x. I finished the motion because
&gt; I
&gt; liked what one poster wrote here, that he couldn't
&gt; imagine shoveling without putting the dirt
&gt; somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, we had to &quot;row across the river&quot; to get to the
&gt; forest. This consisted of kneeling on one knee and
&gt; rowing x20, switching sides and rowing another 20x.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, we chopped down trees to use in the palisade.
&gt; This was &quot;chopping trees&quot; for 20x each side. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then you &quot;load the lumber&quot; onto the boat. This was
&gt; done by squatting with the shovelglove held at arms
&gt; length downward at a 45* in front of you, rising and
&gt; then, with a shift of body weight to that side,
&gt; thrusting the shovelglove sideways while still 
&gt; holding it horizontally in front of you. Think of
&gt; actually loading a board onto the back of a pick up
&gt; truck, this is the motion I used. This was done 10x
&gt; each side.
&gt; 
&gt; Then we &quot;rowed back across the river,&quot; using the
&gt; rows
&gt; used earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; Then we had to &quot;drive the poles,&quot; as described on
&gt; the
&gt; site, 20x each side. This was to set up the village
&gt; defenses &lt;grin&gt;. 
&gt; 
&gt; Afterwards, we &quot;packed the dirt,&quot; which is basically
&gt; churn butter except the shovelglove was held lower
&gt; with the head almost on the ground, 20x. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once we completed the days work, we &quot;celebrated&quot; by
&gt; hoisting the shovelglove overhead with two hands 3x,
&gt; shifting grip and hoisting another 3x. 
&gt; 
&gt; And finally, we &quot;saluted&quot; the king and his entourage
&gt; as they reviewed our handiwork. This was done by
&gt; holding the sloglo down at the side, and using only
&gt; forearms if you can, raise it so it is straight in
&gt; front of you, elbow at your side and forearm
&gt; parallel
&gt; to the ground. This was done 3x each arm (there were
&gt; a
&gt; lot of officials in the parade. ;-) 
&gt; 
&gt; AND FINALLY - WE HAD A BLAST! My teenager loves
&gt; swinging the sloglo and the imagery of it all,as do
&gt; I.
&gt; I need to get a 4 lb for my 11 year old but we will
&gt; all be doing this soon. We are both a little sore
&gt; across the upper back, shoulders, and traps, but
&gt; this
&gt; is a good sore, I assure you. One caveat - I didnt'
&gt; get his done in 14 minutes. It took 20. (I don't
&gt; know
&gt; if you could workout like this much longer than that
&gt; anyway. Makes one wonder how they actually built
&gt; castles and pyramids with manual labor!)
&gt; 
&gt; In our next workout, we are going to &quot;fight off the
&gt; invaders,&quot; since we just &quot;prepared the defenses.&quot;
&gt; This
&gt; will be mostly swinging, chopping, and thrusting
&gt; movements. If anyone wants to read about it, let me
&gt; know, as I do not want to take up a lot of bandwidth
&gt; with these kind of posts if others are not
&gt; interested.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry its so long. I enjoyed it so much though that
&gt; I
&gt; wanted to share it with the other enthusiasts. 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy shovelgloving!

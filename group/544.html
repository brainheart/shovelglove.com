Thanks for all the great info Deb! To answer your question, there is 
no heat or redness (and very little pain now). The swelling starts 
about 5 inches below my elbow and continues to maybe halfway up my 
upper arm. It's not huge, just noticeably puffy. But it barely hurts 
anymore even when I press on the swollen area. The muscle is still a 
bit tight underneath when I try to fully extend my arm, but it's 
improving. The same is true for the right arm except that (a) I can 
extend it fully and (b) no swelling.

If it's still weird after Friday I will try to get medical attn. 
It's just so annoying trying to get in with a doctor I haven't seen 
before...seems like every time I call one, either they're not taking 
new patients or their 1st appt. is at least a month out. I'll go to 
a walkin clinic if I have to.

thanks again. You are a big help!

&gt; .....I have to say, not to be alarmist, that I feel swelling may 
be 
&gt; an indication of a more serious muscle strain... soreness is not 
&gt; uncommon with exercise or even deep tissue massage. Swelling 
isn't 
&gt; a typical response to exercise so if I were you, I might consider 

&gt; really resting this one out and possibly booking an appointment to 

&gt; have it looked at... Where is it swelling? Forearm, whole arm? Is 

&gt; it hot or red?...
&gt; An injury will normally result in an inflammation response where 
&gt; there is Rubor (redness) Calor (heat) and my favorite
&gt; Functio Lasse (Rein help I forgot my Latin... I may have just 
&gt; ordered a Starbucks drink there! LOL)
&gt; or in English, Loss of function. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for icing an area goes, one should only ice for 20 minutes at a 

&gt; time and then take 30 minute breaks in between... If you keep it 
on 
&gt; for too long, you can damage the tissue by overfreezing it, and 
&gt; getting small frostbitten areas and secondly you will end up 
sending 
&gt; a signal to the body to &quot;rush more fluid to the area&quot; in a 

reaction 
&gt; where the body thinks it is freezing and needs to warm up, and 
then 
&gt; you wind up with even more inflammation instead of less...
&gt; Well was that enough of a lecture for you? LOL
&gt; My fee for this visit is $75, I don't take insurance :)
&gt; Good luck Ariel..
&gt; If you have more specific info about your symptoms I am more than 

&gt; happy to try and answer them... Feel free to write me off list!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

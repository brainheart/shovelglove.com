Hey all -

Like many, I've known about shovelglove for awhile now, but it took
some time for me to actually start doing it. I started today (a Monday
instead of the recommended Wednesday) and feel pretty good,
considering how long my body has been on a downward spiral of geek
atrophy. :) I'm sure I'll be sore soon enough, but I'm determined to
keep at it. I've always been an urban ranger and have been following
the equivalent of the NOSdiet for some time now (although it's more
like I keep myself too busy to even think about food: geek &quot;diet&quot;), 
so
I'm okay on those fronts. I'm working on an intentional diet (healthy
maintainence diet, not weight loss diet) for myself, though, because
while I'm not fat, I definitely need to eat *smarter* (i.e. get more
greens &amp; good vitamins).

I have no time available to commute to the gym, so this 14 minute
system works great for me. More importantly, the concept of mimicking
useful manual labor movements just *makes sense* and is something I
can feel good about. I never was a fan of all that wacky gym
machinery! I'm on a 8lb sledge right now because I had one readily
available, but I have a feeling I'll bump up to a 12 after I get past
the initial hump of waking up my poor muscles.

I'll post again with my first week impressions and a photo of my sg
(just for the halibut).

Thank you, Reinhard!

- Kai, 5'5&quot; 23/m from Boston

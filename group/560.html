&gt; Hello All- Just joined up, I'm also in the No-S group so I'll 
spare introductions. I also posted this same question in No-S before 
I found this group. Does shovelgloving make a woman bulk up? I want 
to slim down, not bulk up. Amy

...Amy I posted your answer on NoS :) But I'll post it here too 
since I love to write! Look at Reinhard... Does he look bulky? 
He's chiseled and lovely to look at, like a Michelangelo holding a 
sledgehammer! :) Wouldn't you like that too? :)
You most likely will become, strong, lean, mean, toned... That's 
what I aspire to.. At this point in the game I am *down* almost 2 
inches on my arms... My stomach has such a long way to go, after 
being pretty large and giving birth to an eleven pound baby, so it's 
still pretty much a large massive blob, but it's starting to shrink 
this year too, combining the NoS and SG...To date, I've lost 3.3 
inches from my waist too...
You'd have to really be lifting way more weight than just 
shovelglove to have a noticeable &quot;bulking&quot; effect.. I think that's 

all a big myth...But of course everyone is unique, and every body 
responds differently to exercise...
I believe you can be very feminine and also strong... The idea that 
a woman should not have any muscles at all is, in my opinion a 
sexist ideal which I wouldn't want to be part of. 
Why not try it and see where it leads? Don't let your worries stop 
you from feeling great!
Good luck :)
Debbie

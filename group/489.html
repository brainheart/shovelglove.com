Hey guys! I'm so thrilled about this! I just got a request from my 
son Richard, that he wants me to get him his own Shovelglove! I 
guess an eight pounder will be okay for an almost nine year old :)
I told him you will have to be really careful, and he said &quot;I've 
seen you handle the SG. If I just follow you I will be fine...&quot; and 

he wants to do the workout together with me!(wow I guess I'm 
someones role model! Neato... )


I'm going to have to pray that he develops a fearsome grip or I may 
wind up in the ER! LOL...
Perhaps I will start wearing protective headgear!..
No seriously, I am really proud of my special guy....
Tomorrow we are scheduled to shovel the neighbors driveway and steps 
etc.. since he's going away for a week... Richard is pretty psyched 
to get his little piggies on some green! We're getting 25 bucks.. 
Not bad, but I'm getting the lame end of the deal, as he's getting 
15 and I am getting 10! Lame! LOL :)
I developed a very very very hard move but can't think of good words 
to describe it right now... Actually I have about 5 moves in the 
making...
I had fun doing Shovelglove Capoeira tonight for a few 
minutes...Next time I'll have to get out some Haitian Voodoo music 
and really complete the scene...
I've also been forcing myself to try and do a couple of situps each 
session with the weight resting right about in the middle of my, for 
a lack of better word, boobs! LOL...
Also I'm trying to improve the strength of my spinal erectors for a 
good strong back.. I do this by laying on my stomach and very 
carefully placing the SG on my upper torso and holding with one 
hand, then the other hand stays on the ground for stability... Using 
my breath I lift my shoulders and ribcage up and off the ground 
while at the same time I raise my legs off the ground... then as I 
exhale I lower myself down again... Not an everyday action of my 
cavemen ancestors but I still like it :)
Hope everyone had an ass kicking day!
Love,
Deb

Ok this is beginning to be a lot of trouble. Im entitled to my 
opinions and thats that. If you or anyone feels offended because Im 
happy that I can marry 4 wives or have a harem thats your problem, not 

mine. 

I dont consider myself sexist or chauvinistic or whatever you want to 
portray me. You are just jumping at my throat because I think 
differently.

If I wanted to play your game, I could say YOU are sexist and 
chauvinistic and a feminist or I dont know how you call them. 

Im not in the biz of letting myself be castrated by frustrated women, 
just because they are angry they dont have a penis.

End of story.

&gt; now i am absolutely offended
&gt; and i reeeeeeeeeeeally have to voice my opinion..... try look sexist 

up in the dictionary... and try as well looking up for &quot;chauvinist&quot; 

while ur at it...
&gt; and come on..... harem in the 21st century? what part of Morocco 
have u been living in... and nabil, maybe in ur part of the world u 
dont get sued for staring at a woman s breast... but u certainly 
receive a slap on ur face for it ( that is if she wasnt followed by 
one of her male relatives)\
&gt; now i know how u keep wandering the streets in search for a fight...
! (as u previously mentioned)
&gt; i am deeply offended, and i am sure every woman in here is too... 

and u really should apologize or i d personally cease all future 
contact with u .. i dont want to seem that aggressive... but in my 
part of the world that s how things are..
&gt; u simply are way off the main stream of this group
&gt; ps: how many wives did ur father have at the same time??? i dont 
suppose four.. and neither will u... my father is Egyptian (another 
part of the world where men are allowed to have four wives) and he s 
only ever married my mother... same as for all my uncles
&gt; dee
&gt; sorry Reinhard for adapting such an attitude, but i am deeply 
offended and couldn't keep my mouth shut....

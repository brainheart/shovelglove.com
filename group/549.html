Hey Bloods!
Well I just felt like celebrating with you all because tomorrow 
marks my six month Shovelglove birthday/anniversary here :)
I can truly say, in all honesty, that this group and regimen has 
been a big up for me in my life and has helped me feel better about 
myself than a ton of other accomplishments in the past...
I'm glad I stuck it out and I'm starting to feel and see noticeable 
differences in my body... Mainly my arms of course, since I still 
have yet to figure out how to make a shovelglove stirrup system to 
strap the thing to my stomach and or heinie! But even those are 
shrinking and firming up somewhat... Now my arms feel firm and 
muscular even when I am doing nothing and not &quot;making a 
muscle&quot;...grrrr! :)
This to me is fantastic! 
Well I guess another 18 months or so and I will be looking 
like &quot;Herr Hammermeister&quot; (credit to Lokityrus :)
except with a D cup! :)
I think as a celebration, tomorrow I will go and finally buy my 16 
pounder.. I've been toying around with a 15 lb dumbell at work 
(borrrrriiiiinnnng! I love levers!)
and I think I'm ready! I probably shouldn't spend the money but I 
really want to get a more challenging workout and congratulate 
myself..What was that thing you said a few months back about 
upgrading Rein, something like &quot;let it be the reward for sticking 

with it&quot; ? Well I feel I have really done that. And it will be fun 

to have two hammers going at once! Then I can alternate.. On days 
when I feel like a weakling, I'll use my 12 and when I'm &quot;superdeb&quot; 

it'll be too light so I'll have a heavy one too! And then,,,, 
watchout I may even go to twenty, but that will probably be in six 
years not six months! :)
I'm even telling people at the pt office... Today one of the rehab 
patients asked &quot;why is it good to work out at home&quot;.. I answer &quot;it's 

non-optional&quot;... then they look at me with a &quot;knowing&quot; look which 

stands for, &quot;That makes sense&quot;... actually, this was the first time 

I ever saw this guy smile! (he usually looks miserable as he sits on 
his exercycle going nowhere and scowling at the LED)..... And it's 
all thanks to 
Shovelglove!!!
So lets all give me a big round of applause for my SG birthday (but 
please no paddywagon! LOL )
You have all been very encouraging and great friends!
Love,
Deb

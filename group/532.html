Hey Guys :)
Wow this has been a long day for me :)
I am *not* adjusted to my schedule to say the least.. LOL :)
Well once again I am amazed at how much I love working as a Massage 
Therapist... I just had a really nice session with a new private 
client...very muscular, and fairly tense, but hoping to get some 
stress relief and calm down the nervous system, so open to the work 
and receptive...
Before I started I was so tired and somewhat stressed out by my new 
boss, Bozo, that I didn't know how I would be able to muster up the 
necessary reserves to do a good massage this evening.. I felt like I 
was going to fall on my face and go into a minor coma...Well 
magically, as often happens, as soon as I started to work I was able 
to relax and the session went great... 
But I am going to use this evening to recharge and rejuvenate, and I 
am going to come back full throttle tomorrow with SG.
Gee how do working people do it? LOL... Well my idea of a perfect 
job would be to organize group shovelglove classes and then everyone 
gets a massage after!
Doesn't that sound good? LOL :)
How are you today Ariel? Still in your world of pain? Hope not!
Love and Steel,
Deb :)

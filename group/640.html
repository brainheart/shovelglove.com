&gt; Congrats Deb!!! That's fantastic. Sounds like a great guy. Anyway, 

&gt; as for getting off our butts, I don't know who you're talking 
&gt; to, 'cause I did my SG again last night, as usual (can I even 
&gt; say &quot;usual&quot; after less than 2 weeks? ;) and it felt good. It's not 

&gt; even making me sore anymore, which is amazing

....Ha ha!!! LOL
I was just trying to instigate a response in my usual juvenile 
way!!! LOL... I'm glad you are doing so great Ariel! It couldn't 
happen to a cooler chick!
Thanks for the well wishes for English Peter...
I haven't felt this great for ages!!! LOL
I think I started to doubt whether I'd be dating again ever, as for 
three years now, it has been a mighty dry well. LOL..
He has pretty good arms too, I guess from lugging equipment around 
all the time... I'm going to have to try some arm wrestling pretty 
soon with this guy! That will be the true test! LOLOLOLOLOL!!!!
Keep up the great work Ariel and have loads of fun :)
I will probably be posting a lot less frequently in the next few 
weeks, because I am behind in paying for the DSL and they're gonna 
shut it down until I can pay it off... I'll still check in at the 
local library though, so keep the pact and keep the good energy 
going round...
The Elite forces of Shovelglove will rule the day!
The Pact Lives!
Peace, Sweat and Power!
Deb

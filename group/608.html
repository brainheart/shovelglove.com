get well soon, debbie... very soon (plz plz plz God) cause we re really missing u in 
here.. the most awful part is the fever, once it s over u ll feel MUCH better.. dont 
worry abt SG for now just rest, have plenty of warm liquids and just have loads and 
loads of SLEEP .. 3 more days (tops) and it will be all over (or maybe down to just a 
runny nose and a sore throat)..
take care
love, kisses and lots of &quot;get well &quot;wishes out to u..
(no, internet kisses dont transmit infection.. he he he)

Hya guys :)
I've been using nos and sg as my own personal &quot;support the Deb&quot; 

foundations, so why not today too?
I am home sick for the 4th day in a row and now the fever finally 
hit me...
My regular temp is usually between 97 and 98 but it's up to 102 
right now and I'm feeling very awful...
Please forward all well wishes to 
gratefuldeb.com
and the webmeister, me, will forward them to myself...
I'm trying to stay perky and happy, but it's hard when your hands 
are so cold that they feel like you went into rigor mortis, and your 
head is somewhere in the 7th circle of Dantes inferno....
Hope everyone is groovy...
Send good vibes asap! 
Thanks for listening friends...
I can't believe how much I am missing SG, but till I'm better, I am 
just going to lay low...
Peace and Love,
DEB

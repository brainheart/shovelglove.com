Hmm...
Good points. Have you noticed your wrists acting up, or is this strictly 
preventative? If it is preventative, my suggestion is that you should go without the 
support most of the time, but if you feel like maybe you are edging into troubled 
waters, or if you have a tough one and maybe took it too far, either wear the 
supports or take a day off. Another way of looking at it, and feel free to disagree, 
is that perhaps, as long as the odd stresses from sovelgloving are controlled and of 
short duration, they could actually help as preventative medicine against tendonitis 
that you might otherwise run into in your profession . I would say, though, on the 
job is where you'll have to watch yourself the most, which you obviously already do. 
Very prudent. There are always this type of question with any exercise/lift: is the 
stress adaptive, or is it maladaptive as far as loading/joint angles/duration/repetition, 
and all the other factors. I mean, look at all the arguments powerlifters
and olympic lifters get into over squat depth, stance width, and form!

Hi fellas :)
One thing I wanted to mention in recent weeks is a little problem 
which I think might turn into a bigger one along the line...
My arms and hands are the tools of my trade and I have to protect 
them...I have noticed that it is almost impossible for me to 
shovelglove without having my wrists go into Ulnar and Radial 
deviation or extension of the wrist....I know this isn't going to be 
good for my wrists because we were taught to keep the hand aligned 
and &quot;neutral&quot; when doing massage, to avoid problems like tendinitis 

etc...I was thinking of getting some wrist bandage or soft brace to 
keep my hands from deviation under load.
What do you people think? Anyone ever use this kind of self 
preservation prop in your workouts (shovelglove or other weightlift 
stuff)?
I would really appreciate feedback :)
Have a fantastic day and good weekend.
Deb

Dan,

I really appreciate all this &quot;physiology dork&quot; stuff
-- it's amazing how ignorant I am for someone who has
the nerve to put up an exercise web site.

The &quot;lay off a bit one week a month&quot; makes intuitive
sense -- and hell, those Bulgarians obviously know
what they're talking about. I've lent out my original
12 pounder to my neighbor, but I'm sure we can work
something out. I'll give it a go last week in
December: same 14 minutes, 16 -&gt; 12 pounds, half rep
count (and it'll be even less than that with the extra
s days).

Besides attracting a few more excellent posts like
yours, I think I need to get some video/sequential
stills onto the site to have any hope of it taking
off. I've just been lazy since the original got negged
by my wife. But this spam incident and aftermath may
be just the jolt I needed. Dare I publicly commit
before this newsgroup of 14 members, about a third of
whom are set to &quot;no email,&quot; that I will have something
up by Monday? Uh, sure.

Oh, and if anyone in the group has pictures of
themselves doing shovelglove, I'd be happy to stick
them on the web site (especially if you are a 400
pound deadlifting caveman type :-)).

Thanks again for this (and all your great nosdiet)
posts.

&gt; Reinhard,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a physiology-dork comment to make about your
&gt; routine. You might make faster progress if you
&gt; backed
&gt; off every fourth week--this means go back to the
&gt; lighter weight and do 1/2 of the volume (sets x
&gt; reps)
&gt; of what you normally would. This is an easy way to
&gt; &quot;cycle&quot; and will keep you from stalling for long
&gt; periods of time. Plus it gives your tendons and
&gt; ligaments a break so you won't get overuse injuries.
&gt; 
&gt; So even though you back-off a little bit every
&gt; fourth
&gt; week, the increased level of vigor and ability you
&gt; bring to the table when you come back in weeks 5-7
&gt; will more than make up for the lesser calorie burn
&gt; of
&gt; weeks four and eight. Give it a try for one month
&gt; and
&gt; see if you notice a difference when you come back. 
&gt; 
&gt; I find that planned-backing off (active recovery, if
&gt; you want to use the snobby term for it) is really
&gt; important to my overall progress. If you have time,
&gt; you might want to track down a book called
&gt; &quot;Consistent
&gt; Winning: A Remarkable New Training System That Lets
&gt; You Peak on Demand&quot; by Ronald D. Sandler, D.P.M. and
&gt; Dennis D. Lobstein, PhD. It's out of print, but it's
&gt; a
&gt; nice little book that describes the benefits of
&gt; backing off in no uncertain terms. The simple cycle
&gt; I
&gt; described above isn't from that book, though--it's
&gt; culled from Bulgarian Olympic Weightlifters'
&gt; methods.
&gt; All I know is it works like a charm without getting
&gt; overly complex. Back off every fourth week. How hard
&gt; is that? 
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you mean about having a weird &quot;top
&gt; priority&quot;. I am a student, and my &quot;top priority&quot; of
&gt; the day is getting in my weight workout. A lot of
&gt; times when I don't want to be in class, that
&gt; training
&gt; session motivates me to go to school and get through
&gt; my day so I can get to it. Despite this, I sometimes
&gt; dread training. But it's still my top priority...
&gt; and
&gt; it's actually pretty fun once I pull that first
&gt; deadlift. :) People look at me like I'm a caveman
&gt; who's just grunting and dropping 400 pounds in the
&gt; corner over and over again, but it's my therapy. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am probably going to incorporate some
&gt; shovelgloving
&gt; into my workouts in January. I've been focusing on
&gt; building limit strength at the expense of body
&gt; composition (I'm up to a fairly chubby 18%), and
&gt; nothing leans you out faster than old-fashioned hard
&gt; work. Plus, swinging a sledgehammer is so much more
&gt; &quot;butch&quot; than running on a treadmill with a little
&gt; heartrate monitor strapped on. 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I've heard of people who have actually
&gt; gotten injured as a result of too much treadmill
&gt; work:
&gt; since the treadmill moves beneath you instead of
&gt; your
&gt; muscles working to push you forward, the treadmill
&gt; can
&gt; chronically underdevelop certain muscles. Then when
&gt; you try to, say, run or walk in the real world, you
&gt; hurt yourself because your musculature isn't ready
&gt; for
&gt; the loads. Then you have to ice your feet, and
&gt; that's
&gt; no fun.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, not to get off on too much of a tangent--a
&gt; lot of gym equipment does the same thing. If you
&gt; press
&gt; on a &quot;pressing machine&quot; you develop the primary
&gt; movers
&gt; without developing any of the supporting musculature
&gt; that steadies and balances the load. Then when you
&gt; have to press something in the real world, your
&gt; stabilizers aren't up to the task, and you fail on
&gt; the
&gt; press, or drop the thing on your head, or you hurt
&gt; yourself. And I find that completely ironic, since
&gt; machines are supposed to be &quot;safer&quot;. They turn you
&gt; into a muscle-moron who can't use the strength he(or
&gt; she--women LOVE machines) has built. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, Shovelglove is imminently &quot;real
&gt; world&quot; applicable. When the time comes to, say,
&gt; shovel
&gt; or sledgehammer or chop wood or even just heft a
&gt; heavy
&gt; object, you will be ready to do it, because you've
&gt; done it so many times in training. I like that
&gt; there's
&gt; a chance you could hurt yourself while you use
&gt; it--you
&gt; have to respect it, which makes you mindful of your
&gt; workout. And I like that. There's nothing worse than
&gt; just &quot;zoning out&quot; while you work out. Why waste that
&gt; time? You should be alive instead of mindlessly
&gt; pumping out digital &quot;miles&quot; on a treadmill (urban
&gt; ranger, anyone? the real world has real miles to
&gt; walk,
&gt; and much better scenery) or endless reps on a
&gt; mindless
&gt; machine. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, here's hoping from my end that shovelglove
&gt; starts to take off like the NOS diet. Because I
&gt; think
&gt; its as simple and just as practical--and perhaps
&gt; even
&gt; more useful in the end when physical fitness is
&gt; suddenly called for. (This happens more often than
&gt; people seem to think.)
&gt; 
&gt; Wow--sorry that got so long, I'm living on an hour
&gt; of
&gt; sleep in the last 24. I tend to ramble--altered
&gt; states
&gt; and all that.

&gt; &gt; I should have taken care of this when I did
&gt; nosdiet.
&gt; &gt; Oh well. Done now.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My routine is still pretty much as described in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; last stage of the site. The only difference is I'm
&gt; &gt; now
&gt; &gt; using the 16 pounder and am actually able to get
&gt; &gt; through it all with some time left over for
&gt; &gt; freestyle.
&gt; &gt; I also have a couple of preferred freestyle
&gt; &gt; movements.
&gt; &gt; The &quot;fireman&quot; which mimics chopping through a door
&gt; &gt; (&quot;battle axe&quot; might be another good way to imagine
&gt; &gt; it). And &quot;smash the ceiling&quot; which is sort of like
&gt; &gt; butter churning in the opposite direction.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My lack of tweaks to the routine (and the site)
&gt; &gt; doesn't mean lack of observance. If anything, I've
&gt; &gt; only gotten more religious about doing it over
&gt; time.
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; very rarely miss a (non-s-day) morning. I'm able
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; this because: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) I know it doesn't take a lot of time 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2) I know how miserable I feel if I don't do it
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; how happy and energized I feel when I do. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3) I know it's actually kind of fun once I take
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; first swing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4) I make it my top priority every day. Once I'm
&gt; &gt; sufficiently awake to remember what planet I'm on,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; think &quot;before I leave the house, I'm doing
&gt; &gt; shovelglove. No excuses.&quot; It might sound crazy
&gt; when
&gt; &gt; you think that there are more objectively more
&gt; &gt; important things (discovering the meaning of life,
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; getting fired from work, not being a bastard to
&gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; I care about, etc.) but having a top priority
&gt; that's
&gt; &gt; so completely within one's control and easy to
&gt; &gt; achieve
&gt; &gt; only helps these other bigger but fuzzier ends.

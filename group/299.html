Life is good, but tireing. 
I've been trying to keep up the 14 min a day but not always with the
ShovelGlove.

...Wait till you get to your late thirties, you are still a &quot;semi&quot; 

young guy (at least according to your profile, and btw, is that 
actually your picture!? LOL, it is for a lack of a better word 
very &quot;vague&quot; LOL)
So my feeling is, better to do something than nothing, and don't 
bother guilting yourself out when you are in a very tired 
state...Just catch those moments when you can, and hope it 
eventually builds up and sticks...
What do you do for a living? Before I was a massage therapist, I 
used to do lots of weird odd jobs... One of them was a car parts 
delivery girl...All foreign cars, like bmw etc... Boy those disc 
brakes and huge mufflers etc, got me in pretty good lifting shape 
back then, but boy did it take it's toll, especially being on a 
strict schedule and doing all that in traffic driving...
Shovelglove is just so fun, but yes, when I am left to my own 
devices (&quot;bad habits&quot; I guess) I do really procrastinate, and put 

off even the things I like! Which is really crazy...so I am really 
going to start &quot;Slashing&quot; days I do SG on my calendar, as some sort 

of means to &quot;schedulize&quot; my unscheduled, procrastinating self...
Maybe I will give myself a reward for each week completed.
Can anyone think of anything good as a SG reward?
It's really funny. After I had my scale smashing &quot;incident&quot; LOL
I went into my toolchest to find my normal hammer, you know, to put 
up my trophy on the wall, when I picked it up, it felt about as 
heavy as a pair of tweezers, and I let out a big laugh at the 
strangeness of it all... Now, thanks to Shovelglove, and also my 
massage, I can open a really tight pickle jar without even trying! 
LOL
Peace,
Deb

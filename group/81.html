Please, feel free to use any of my correspondence or
descriptions on your site. I feel honored :-) 

I didn't mean to imply that I had come up with
something new over what you have already done with the
farming moves. Forgive me if it came across that way.
I was thinking about what chores would be done at what
time and tried to take myself through a day at the
farm, thats all. I in no way want to usurp credit for
any of your creative ideas, Reinhard. Without you we
might all still be er, shoveling food in our faces all
day long and watching the tube for those crucial 14
minutes a day ;-)

&gt; Thanks again, Allan. I didn't actually get around to
&gt; a
&gt; scenario last week (I figured experimenting with
&gt; &quot;swiss automaton&quot; was enough novelty for one week),
&gt; but one thing that did occur to me is that the
&gt; movements I'm currently doing and have published on
&gt; the site are all (at least tenuously) farming
&gt; related,
&gt; and that this is a kind of scenario. So I don't
&gt; think
&gt; what you've posted is a stretch at all. You read my
&gt; mind, in fact. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope you don't mind if I quote some of your choicer
&gt; descriptions on the movements pages... I love the
&gt; &quot;hey, it's gotta be done.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to &quot;Lewis and Clark,&quot;

&gt; &gt; Here is my latest attempt at scenario based
&gt; &gt; shovelglove. I don't feel this is as creative as
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; others and some of the moves may be a stretch, but
&gt; &gt; here it is anyway.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; NOTE: I couldn't think of any moves to replicate
&gt; &gt; picking up eggs or milking cows, but then again
&gt; &gt; those
&gt; &gt; aren't that strenuous to begin with.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Start the day with &quot;feeding the animals.&quot; This
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; done by shoveling to the side, bringing it to the
&gt; &gt; front, and 'dumping' the food in the trough. Of
&gt; &gt; course
&gt; &gt; I held the shovelglove head horizontal for the
&gt; &gt; shoveling movement and then rotated it sideways to
&gt; &gt; dump the food. We did this 10x to each side. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2) Next we &quot;churned butter&quot; 20x. This is already
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the site, no explanation needed (NEN.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3) Then we &quot;loaded bales.&quot; This is done by holding
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; shovelglove horizontally in front of you,
&gt; squatting
&gt; &gt; down, with the sg still horizontal, coming up then
&gt; &gt; 'tossing' the bale into the truck / wagon / cart.
&gt; It
&gt; &gt; was my intention to do this 20x per side, but 10x
&gt; &gt; each
&gt; &gt; side in 2 sets is how it turned out. It was
&gt; quickly
&gt; &gt; fatiguing. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4) Then we &quot;pitched hay.&quot; I believe this is more
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; less already described on the site, but what we
&gt; did
&gt; &gt; was use a shoveling movement (to scoop the hay)
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; raised the shovelglove straight up, as though to
&gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; the hay in an overhead loft. 10x each side. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5) Then we &quot;shoveled manure.&quot; Hey its got to be
&gt; done
&gt; &gt; &lt;grin&gt;. This was 10x over shoulder, 10x to side,
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; 10x to the front, with a grip change and second
&gt; set
&gt; &gt; for the left side. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 6) And finally we &quot;mended fences.&quot; This was a
&gt; &gt; combination of 'pole driving,' which we did 10x to
&gt; &gt; each side, and a new move I titled &quot;pulling wire.&quot;
&gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; shovelglove is held at shoulder height, head away
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; you handle close to the chest. You &quot;pull&quot; the
&gt; &gt; shovelglove head towards you, then push back out
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; repeat. Think of the 'shoot the bow' motion,
&gt; except
&gt; &gt; that the shovelglove is held horizontally instead
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; vertically. This one burned out our arms in
&gt; nothing
&gt; &gt; flat. We did only 10x to each side.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I forgot to start the clock when we began, but I
&gt; &gt; estimate it took about 12-13 minutes to complete
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; scenario. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am working on &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark&quot; next. I'll advise
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; soon as we complete it.

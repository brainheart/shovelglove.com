Hi Storm,

Thanks for posting this. I'm continually amazed that
this crazy routine I concocted for myself even works,
that experts and serious muscleheads agree (or
entertain lively disagreement) is way more than I ever
expected. I'll keep poking around these sites, but if
anything especially interesting pops up, don't
hesitate to post it here.

Reinhard

P.S. By &quot;musclehead&quot; I mean people with serious
muscles who have seriously used their heads to get
that way. Don't want some offended UK submission
fighter to hop on the next flight to Boston to inquire
in person...

&gt; This woman is very cool. She is a weight training
&gt; goddess with a vast amount of knowledge and she
&gt; trains for results!
&gt; 
&gt; All the way from Merry Old England (and they would
&gt; beat the stuffing out of me with ease) SFUK
&gt; (Submission Fighting United Kingdom) Links
&gt; shovelglove very frequently. That is saying
&gt; something because they are really anti-hype,
&gt; pro-results, experienced, practical, and frugal.

&gt; Bryce Lane's Message Board, the IRON WORKS. 
&gt; Excellent material. Bryce is one of those people
&gt; who has a great ability to put things together. 
&gt; Below is a link to a thread dealing with shovelglove
&gt; and controversy!

&gt; But it is apparent that the majority of people in
&gt; the forum like the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted Reinhard and all of you to know the
&gt; impact you're having. There were more sites, blogs,
&gt; etc, but I don't know those people, so I didn't
&gt; include those links.

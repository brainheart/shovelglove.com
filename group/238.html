&gt; Don't worry, nothing serious, just the handle. Got a
&gt; bit of a bump, but went right on shovelgloving (how's
&gt; that for shoglo-macho?). My wife burst out laughing
&gt; when I told her. I guess it was bound to happen
&gt; eventually, right? Basically I decided to look down
&gt; while &quot;churning butter&quot; and jabbed myself right above
&gt; the eye. I wish my office weren't such a ghost town
&gt; this morning, I wanted to walk in and greet everyone's
&gt; astonished stares with &quot;you should see the other guy.&quot;

Ice it every hour Reinhard. This is crucial in healing and lowering 
your inflammation...Ibuprofen has a good effect too.
19 minutes on, and once it is numb stop...
Take a break for a half hour...
Then another icing for 19...
If you don't have ice, use frozen food, like a bag of frozen corn or 
if desperate, whatever lean cuisine your boss had planned for 
lunch :)

That sounds like perfect material for Americas Home Videos..did you 
capture it on Quicktime...just kidding, I hope you feel better soon.
It's a little weird that you wrote about &quot;looking down&quot; as the 

culprit, because as I was working out just now, I thought &quot;hey I 
should really write to Reinhard about his form in the Quicktime 
videos and it was that precise movement &quot;looking down&quot; I was going 

to mention, in things to avoid while SG...Weird man.
Hope you feel better soon
Love,
Deb

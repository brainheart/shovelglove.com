Well there are some advatages to my condition!
When I'm &quot;up and a'tem&quot; it really helps me get the superhuman 

strength I need for a great workout!
I just did a bunch of awesome stuff :)
I was swingin that lasso like there's no tomorrow!
Ride'em Grateful Deb!!! Yeeehaw!
I've managed to be able to do 10 overhead circles in each direction 
and it's getting real smooth.. Feels like I am playing hula hoop!

Also, I have developed, over the last month or so, a hmm not really 
new move, but well a variation... I love the chopping wood stuff, 
but I really like the Fireman better.. So these are the two ways I 
like to do the Fireman.. first one is, instead of breaking the SG as 
it &quot;breaks down the door&quot;, I just keep making continual circular 

hits with no abrupt &quot;break&quot; motion... just let the thing come round 

full circle and keep it rolling as long as possible.. Then switch..
The other more interesting, and potentially dangerous move I like, 
and this really get the breath moving and the blood pumping is 
Shovelglove &quot;Pitching Baseballs&quot;... This requires that you have at 

least 12 or 13 feet to &quot;Step into the pitch&quot;... Just pretend the Sg 

is a baseball and you are Darryl Strawberry (but without the crack 
cocaine)
Then after you &quot;Pitch&quot; it, just step back and do it again and 

again...
NB...DON'T LET GO! LOL :)

Believe it or not, the forward momentum, as long as you are not a 
complete spazz or too fast, doesn't make this move more unstable, it 
actually helps to step into it...Try these moves guys they are 
awesome! Oh Richard, I still can't get into a third round of Tabata 
with my &quot;Hoists&quot; LOL... I did two sets and breathed like hell and 

then by the third time I was dead!!! LOLOLOL... I am sure I will get 
that down one day :) 
The SG feels great today guys!
I think I will be keeping it in my bed like a teddy bear tonight!
I need to think of a name for my trusty ax...
Mathilda? Nah, too gay... LOL :)
I'll think of something :)
Peace all Warriors!
Rock On!
Deb

Ariel,

If you've a bathtub istead of a shower at your place
get some Epsom salts, they are pretty cheap i sparred
alot when i was younger and i swear by epsom salt to
relieve soreness.

&gt; Hi Deb - thanks for the advice. My body is
&gt; definitely giving me some 
&gt; clear messages today. The muscle soreness has just
&gt; gotten worse 
&gt; throughout the day (as muscle soreness often does).
&gt; I have to keep 
&gt; my arms slightly bent all the time b/c it hurts too
&gt; much to 
&gt; straighten them out. And my back is pretty bad too
&gt; (don't worry - it 
&gt; doesn't feel like an injury, just muscles). I may
&gt; not be able to do 
&gt; 2 days in a row to begin with. I wish I knew how it
&gt; was for Reinhard 
&gt; at the beginning - R, if you see this, could you
&gt; maybe give me an 
&gt; overview of how you started?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Ariel

&gt; &gt; Ariel, you should just respect the cues your body
&gt; is giving you... 
&gt; &gt; if you can't do 5 days a week right away then do
&gt; as much as you 
&gt; feel 
&gt; &gt; you can... it will eventually build up and you
&gt; won't even notice 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; as it becomes part of your lifestyle.... As I said
&gt; before, there 
&gt; &gt; were plenty of weeks last year when I would only
&gt; do say, 3 or even 
&gt; 2 
&gt; &gt; times a week... I really started to get regular by
&gt; around 
&gt; December, 
&gt; &gt; and then I made my New Years pact of Blood
&gt; resolution which has 
&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; unbroken since! Also, remember that I have been
&gt; &quot;kneading&quot; bodies 
&gt; &gt; for three years now, if you include the time I was
&gt; in school too, 
&gt; &gt; and that got my hands and wrist flexors and
&gt; extensors pretty toned 
&gt; &gt; to begin with... You don't want to have the glove
&gt; go flying 
&gt; through 
&gt; &gt; a window or into your temporal lobes, so listen
&gt; carefully to your 
&gt; &gt; body and workout when you are not tired, to reduce
&gt; the chance of 
&gt; &gt; hurting yourself or spazzing out (even Reinhard
&gt; has had his day 
&gt; &gt; in &quot;ouchland&quot; when he hit himself in the face with
&gt; the handle, but 
&gt; &gt; no one was at work that day so he couldn't show
&gt; off his shiner to 
&gt; &gt; anyone! Except his wife who laughed at him! LOL)
&gt; &gt; Well enjoy your day of rest.. I'm starting again
&gt; tomorrow (sorry 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; that's sacrilegious :)
&gt; &gt; Love,
&gt; &gt; Deb
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;

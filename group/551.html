*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP* Congrats Deb!!!! Your results are really 
inspiring to me. And impressive...going up to 16 lbs, holy crap. I 
can't imagine ever being able to do that. Maybe someday. You are not 
helping my impatience to try this again :) Anyway, way to go and 
keep it up!! Hope you have a great weekend! (and a peaceful one, 
with less emotional trauma)

&gt; Hey Bloods!
&gt; Well I just felt like celebrating with you all because tomorrow 
&gt; marks my six month Shovelglove birthday/anniversary here :)
&gt; I can truly say, in all honesty, that this group and regimen has 
&gt; been a big up for me in my life and has helped me feel better 
about 
&gt; myself than a ton of other accomplishments in the past...
&gt; I'm glad I stuck it out and I'm starting to feel and see 
noticeable 
&gt; differences in my body... Mainly my arms of course, since I still 

&gt; have yet to figure out how to make a shovelglove stirrup system to 

&gt; strap the thing to my stomach and or heinie! But even those are 
&gt; shrinking and firming up somewhat... Now my arms feel firm and 
&gt; muscular even when I am doing nothing and not &quot;making a 
&gt; muscle&quot;...grrrr! :)
&gt; This to me is fantastic! 
&gt; Well I guess another 18 months or so and I will be looking 
&gt; like &quot;Herr Hammermeister&quot; (credit to Lokityrus :)
&gt; except with a D cup! :)
&gt; I think as a celebration, tomorrow I will go and finally buy my 16 

&gt; pounder.. I've been toying around with a 15 lb dumbell at work 
&gt; (borrrrriiiiinnnng! I love levers!)
&gt; and I think I'm ready! I probably shouldn't spend the money but I 

&gt; really want to get a more challenging workout and congratulate 
&gt; myself..What was that thing you said a few months back about 
&gt; upgrading Rein, something like &quot;let it be the reward for sticking 

&gt; with it&quot; ? Well I feel I have really done that. And it will be 

fun 
&gt; to have two hammers going at once! Then I can alternate.. On days 

&gt; when I feel like a weakling, I'll use my 12 and when 
I'm &quot;superdeb&quot; 
&gt; it'll be too light so I'll have a heavy one too! And then,,,, 
&gt; watchout I may even go to twenty, but that will probably be in six 

&gt; years not six months! :)
&gt; I'm even telling people at the pt office... Today one of the rehab 

&gt; patients asked &quot;why is it good to work out at home&quot;.. I 

answer &quot;it's 
&gt; non-optional&quot;... then they look at me with a &quot;knowing&quot; look which 

&gt; stands for, &quot;That makes sense&quot;... actually, this was the first 

time 
&gt; I ever saw this guy smile! (he usually looks miserable as he sits 

on 
&gt; his exercycle going nowhere and scowling at the LED)..... And it's 

&gt; all thanks to 
&gt; Shovelglove!!!
&gt; So lets all give me a big round of applause for my SG birthday 
(but 
&gt; please no paddywagon! LOL )
&gt; You have all been very encouraging and great friends!
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

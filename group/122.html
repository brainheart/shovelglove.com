thanks Reinhard!

I've been using your list as a reference (50 each shovel, 20 churn, 20=20
chop, 8 lever) and by the lever section my arms are toast... but it's a=20
good pain.

the only issue I seem to be having is I don't feel the shovel in my=20
stomach like I think I should. I feel it in my back... sore... not=20
pain... but I feel it. Abs not so much.

suggestions anyone on how to hone the movement (yes, I tried the video=20
- but can't seem to emulate it properly)

thanks all,

a. (That's for adam, btw)

&gt; &gt; After finishing my 14 minutes.. I have to say...
&gt; &gt; that was HELL.=A0 I
&gt; &gt; can't believe how tired I
&gt; &gt; feel... how much sweat I expended.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I prefer to think of it as purgatory. Hell is eternal,
&gt; after all, this is just 14 minutes. Seriously, make it
&gt; a habit and it gets fun and more or less automatic
&gt; (contradictory as that may sound). Do make sure to do
&gt; the movements slowly and smoothly, soreness is fine,
&gt; but *pain* should not happen. Start with a small
&gt; number of slow smooth reps at a time and ramp it up
&gt; really gradually. You can always do a second or third
&gt; set if you have time to spare. You'll 1) get a sense
&gt; of what you can do 2) slowly prepare those underused
&gt; muscles to do more.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck, and keep us posted.
&gt;

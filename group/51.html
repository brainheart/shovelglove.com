Johnny,

Thanks for this detailed post. I stuck my comments
after each point below.

&gt; I have gotten through my first month of shovelglove.
&gt; I've modified the
&gt; exercises slightly from the ones presented on the
&gt; site as follows
&gt; because they work better for me, both physically and
&gt; mentally. 

That's the idea. The movements I give are just
examples, points of inspiration. The important things
are the &quot;useful movements&quot; metaphor, schedualistically
insignificant time, and the SG itself. Thanks for &quot;SG&quot;
by the way. The full name is a bit of a mouthful.
&quot;Shoglo&quot; is another one that's been suggested to me.
Not quite as short, perhaps, but charming.

&gt; 
&gt; 1) shoveling. The main change I have made to this
&gt; was to add a
&gt; secondary movement. I have two movements that I use:
&gt; 
&gt; a) I swing the SG around and over the shoulder of
&gt; the arm holding the
&gt; middle of the SG as if I am flinging the contents of
&gt; the shovel behind
&gt; me. I find that this gives me a nice twisting motion
&gt; that works my
&gt; back and adds a lifting motion. 
&gt; 
&gt; b) I thrust the SG forward as if to toss the
&gt; contents of the shovel to
&gt; the other side of the hole I am digging. I don't
&gt; enjoy this motion as
&gt; much but it does make some nice arm work. 

I love these. It shows that you're really buying into
the idea, that it's not just making some arbitrary
movement. That's what keeps it interesting.

&gt; 
&gt; 2) Hoist the Sack. I do this as sort of a reverse
&gt; butter churn. I hold
&gt; the handle of the SG with both hands and lift behind
&gt; my head as
&gt; quickly as posible. I swap hand positions and repeat
&gt; my reps. 

I'm not sure why I do butter churn with two arms and
hoist the sack with one. I should add the two arm
alternate to the sack hoist page (with credit to you,
of course).

&gt; 
&gt; 3) Driving Fence posts. Unchanged. I like this one.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Chopping Trees. Like Driving Fence Posts but
&gt; horizontally. 
&gt; 

Justin mentioned this too. I don't do it regularly
because I thought it was making my back sore, but I
may have just been imagining it (or overdoing it). I
should give it another shot. It's such an obvious real
world movement, and it must be fantastic for your gut.

&gt; 5) Spear Thrust. Thrust forward with the SG while
&gt; stepping forward
&gt; with your front foot. Recover back without dropping
&gt; the SG down. Don't
&gt; do this with slippery hands or in front of a window
&gt; if you have poor
&gt; depth perception. 

This sounds like &quot;stoke the oven&quot; except with a
perhaps more compelling metaphor. Mind if I add this
image to the page as an alternate?

&gt; 
&gt; 6) Railroad Spike. Like Driving Fence Posts but step
&gt; forward with your
&gt; front foot and bring the SG as close to the ground
&gt; as you can without
&gt; hitting it. 
&gt; 
&gt; 7) Flip the Lever. I bring my arm all the way up so
&gt; that the SG is
&gt; almost on my shoulder. For half of them I add a
&gt; secondary motion by
&gt; thrusting up. If you are holding the SG in the
&gt; middle you should
&gt; probably only do this if you have reasonably strong
&gt; wrists. 

Interesting. Sounds like a cross between flip the
lever and the miserably named &quot;tuck the bales.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; I haven't changed the 14 min at all though.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I've been doing this for a month and I'm
&gt; seeing visible
&gt; improvement which is nice. 

I'm so glad to hear it. Keep us posted. Best regards
to your cat.

Reinhard

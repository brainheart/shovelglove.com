I just picked up my 10lb sledge on the weekend and intent to start on
Wednesday. Why post that here? 'cause a friend was reading
www.stumptuous.com and posted me the shovel link. Gotta say, its the
first time i've ever been interested in working out! Thanks Reinhard
for coming up with this simple yet brilliant idea :)

&gt; Hi Storm,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for posting this. I'm continually amazed that
&gt; this crazy routine I concocted for myself even works,
&gt; that experts and serious muscleheads agree (or
&gt; entertain lively disagreement) is way more than I ever
&gt; expected. I'll keep poking around these sites, but if
&gt; anything especially interesting pops up, don't
&gt; hesitate to post it here.
&gt; 
&gt; Reinhard
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. By &quot;musclehead&quot; I mean people with serious
&gt; muscles who have seriously used their heads to get
&gt; that way. Don't want some offended UK submission
&gt; fighter to hop on the next flight to Boston to inquire
&gt; in person...

&gt; &gt; This woman is very cool. She is a weight training
&gt; &gt; goddess with a vast amount of knowledge and she
&gt; &gt; trains for results!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All the way from Merry Old England (and they would
&gt; &gt; beat the stuffing out of me with ease) SFUK
&gt; &gt; (Submission Fighting United Kingdom) Links
&gt; &gt; shovelglove very frequently. That is saying
&gt; &gt; something because they are really anti-hype,
&gt; &gt; pro-results, experienced, practical, and frugal.

&gt; &gt; Bryce Lane's Message Board, the IRON WORKS. 
&gt; &gt; Excellent material. Bryce is one of those people
&gt; &gt; who has a great ability to put things together. 
&gt; &gt; Below is a link to a thread dealing with shovelglove
&gt; &gt; and controversy!

&gt; &gt; But it is apparent that the majority of people in
&gt; &gt; the forum like the idea.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just wanted Reinhard and all of you to know the
&gt; &gt; impact you're having. There were more sites, blogs,
&gt; &gt; etc, but I don't know those people, so I didn't
&gt; &gt; include those links.

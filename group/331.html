&gt; &gt; Well, today I did my SG workout.. went well, it does seem to be 

&gt; getting a bit easier.. I can really feel it in my arms and abdomen. 

&gt; 
&gt; ....That's cool! It's funny, but I really never feel it in my abs, 

&gt; so I am just going straight to the situps using the weight on my 
&gt; chest for resistance... I'm not sure why, but I have a feeling it's 

&gt; because I don't like twisting motions much, as I know that torqueing 

&gt; (sp?) the spine is pretty risky...so all that oblique movement which 

&gt; you are, most likely feeling in the transverse abs, I am 
&gt; avoiding...

Actually, I'm feeling it right in the center, but I am inventing new motions 

for the side abs. :)

Also, when I was pregnant, my abs got pretty seriously 
&gt; stretched (I went up to 250! and I am 5'4&quot;)

Wow.. the most I've ever weighed was around 220 (and I'm 6'3&quot;!) So, um, yeah. 

Right now (as of this morning, before my workout, I weighed in at 202). My 

goal is about 180-190 or so. Slender, yet toned and firm. I don't follow NOs, 

but I am incorporating more raw foods into my diet, so that ought to help. 
ALOT.

so I think they can't 
&gt; feel anything anymore! LOL :) BTW, Sneezing Weasels sounds like a 

&gt; Dead spinoff band! :)

LOL, it does! That name came about while I was searching for a Yahoo ID one 

day.. for about 20 minutes!.. I got frustrated, because everything I wanted was 

already taken.. so I tried SneezingWeasels, and what do you know, that one 

was available. :)

&gt; &gt;On Saturday I went for a 4 mile rather fast paced walk (ended up 

&gt; doing it in an hour and 6 minutes). I'm still recovering from that.. 

&gt; I could really feel THAT in my hips, and feet.
&gt; 
&gt; ....Hey a real weekend warrior! :)
&gt; Have you visited Reinhards other site, www.urbanranger.com ?
&gt; You sound really stoked! Have fun Art :)

Thanks! I am going for another one today. And, I just finished my SG workout. 

(I'm a weekday warrior, too. Being self-employed and living at home with Mom 

gives me all this wonderful extra time!)

&gt; Okay hammer, time to transform myself from sluggish to 
&gt; supersledged :)
&gt; (..now where was that coffee?)
&gt; It's funny, because the song I like to SG to is a live Dead 
&gt; recording which takes up more than 80% of the 14 minutes :)
&gt; Oy I'm still sitting here...
&gt; alright alright, I'm going now....LOL

LOL.. today's selection was Vengeance Rising, a defunct Christian metal band. 

Heavy metal really gets me pumping. :)

SG is definitely better with music, though. Then again, so is walking, though 

I did without the other day, because I just wanted to get out and get it done 

while it was still light out. If I took the time to look through my stuff for 

a CD player, headphones, batteries, CDs, etc., I never would have made it out 

on time. Though, I have a feeling, the right music will prompt me to walk 

faster. :)

Hey guys (and theoretical girls....cept DanYell.. we know you are 
not theoretical :)
I had a one week sabbatical from SG due to a very debilitating week 
of womens problems, namely my ex husband! LOL
(oh and I had my period too...)
So suffice it to say, my proprioceptors screamed at me a little when 
I started off today...and believe it or not I started with the idea 
of doing my sg in my chair today! LOL Well I was up and at'em 
within 20 seconds...and then by 4 minutes I was dancing around for 
joy, sweatin to the oldies LOL (the Dead are old, especially Jerry 
who *is* Dead!)
I came up with another variation on a theme during some freestyle 
ala Deb......Start the lawn mower! 
It's like a reverse version of stoke the oven, or thrust the spear, 
however, whereas I hate those because they really get too far away 
from my center and I feel they could end up injuring my 
neck/shoulder and maybe low back? When you do a reverse version, 
the idea is to imagine that you are trying to start one of those 
lawn mowers which require you to pull hard and quickly on the 
starter cord, and you are pulling in... or think of it as tug of war?
And you are the anchor guy who needs to yank the team over the line 
with one really abrupt and strong pull...Now, don't go nuts with the 
pulling and accidentally wind up massaging your spleen or liver...
This felt really nice. I have been inside *WAY* too much and my job 
is pretty sleepy this week.. So thank God for that 14 minutes its a 
mood enhancer to say the least :) So are any other people coming up 
with wild and wacky sg moves? Hmmmm?
Love and Peace,
Deb

Hi Deb - thanks for the advice. My body is definitely giving me some 
clear messages today. The muscle soreness has just gotten worse 
throughout the day (as muscle soreness often does). I have to keep 
my arms slightly bent all the time b/c it hurts too much to 
straighten them out. And my back is pretty bad too (don't worry - it 
doesn't feel like an injury, just muscles). I may not be able to do 
2 days in a row to begin with. I wish I knew how it was for Reinhard 
at the beginning - R, if you see this, could you maybe give me an 
overview of how you started?

thanks,
Ariel

&gt; Ariel, you should just respect the cues your body is giving you... 

&gt; if you can't do 5 days a week right away then do as much as you 
feel 
&gt; you can... it will eventually build up and you won't even notice 
it 
&gt; as it becomes part of your lifestyle.... As I said before, there 
&gt; were plenty of weeks last year when I would only do say, 3 or even 

2 
&gt; times a week... I really started to get regular by around 
December, 
&gt; and then I made my New Years pact of Blood resolution which has 
been 
&gt; unbroken since! Also, remember that I have been &quot;kneading&quot; bodies 

&gt; for three years now, if you include the time I was in school too, 

&gt; and that got my hands and wrist flexors and extensors pretty toned 

&gt; to begin with... You don't want to have the glove go flying 
through 
&gt; a window or into your temporal lobes, so listen carefully to your 

&gt; body and workout when you are not tired, to reduce the chance of 
&gt; hurting yourself or spazzing out (even Reinhard has had his day 
&gt; in &quot;ouchland&quot; when he hit himself in the face with the handle, but 

&gt; no one was at work that day so he couldn't show off his shiner to 

&gt; anyone! Except his wife who laughed at him! LOL)
&gt; Well enjoy your day of rest.. I'm starting again tomorrow (sorry 
if 
&gt; that's sacrilegious :)
&gt; Love,
&gt; Deb

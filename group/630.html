Hey guys. Caught up on posts to try and get some inspiration. I 
have my lovely hammer all situated and resting against my closet 
door. Crying out for attention! It's so pretty how it turned out, 
I need to take a picture of it - I think I even want to name it! 
Ohh, Athena. Nice strong name yah. Anyway... (Wow, I am goofy 
today)

I had intended to wake up 15 minutes early every morning to do this, 
and I tried once. I apparently, have no energy or physical strength 
in the morning. I wake up at 7:40 - brush teeth, get dressed, brush 
hair and shoes. Then out the door. Maybe I am not giving myself 
enough time to wake up and get the blood pumping, but I don't want 
to wake up even earlier to do this. 

So I've ended up not doing much at all. At most, I've lasted about 
6 minutes and stopped before any real effort could be put into it. 
I feel awful! 

After work, I hurry home for dinner. Or, if it's not a gym workout 
day, I play some DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for some at home 
cardio. I can't seem to find a good time to fit Shovelglove into 
my schedule. 

Help!

Other than that, things are going well. I just can't wait till I 
get nice, sleek and toned arms and back. I may even be able to get 
into a tank top this summer!

-Nay

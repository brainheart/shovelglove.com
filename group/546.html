Hi Deb,

Ugh, that really sounds like a not fun day. I'm sorry you had such a 
rough time. ((hugs)) I tend to be afraid of the dark too - even at 
the ripe old age of 27. ;P Anyway, that sucks about the car. I guess 
it's not in a garage? Is there any way you could throw a tarp or 
cover over it to keep it from freezing shut again? I wish you better 
luck tomorrow morning - being on time to work is NOT worth monoxide 
poisoning! :)

take care,
Ariel

&gt; Hey Guys :)
&gt; Will someone please buy me a new car? LOL...
&gt; Or at least an exhaust...
&gt; We had quite a stressful evening yesterday, what with the snow, 
ice 
&gt; and wind gusting, which caused our power to go out for 2 or 3 
hours..
&gt; I was making dinner while holding a flashlight over my spagetti!
&gt; To be honest it was a bit scary there for a little while because, 

&gt; firstly I get freaked out when there's no light, mildly, but 
&gt; nonetheless, enough to drain my batteries from stress.. then our 
&gt; heat doesn't work without the electicity for the thermostat, so I 

&gt; was thinking we would be very cold as the temps were in the teens 

&gt; last night...
&gt; The worst thing was I was in a huge rush to get to work, because 
I'm 
&gt; still not into the swing of getting up and going, and my car which 

&gt; has a gigantic hole in the front exhaust pipes was frozen, and I 
&gt; didn't leave myself enough time to defrost it with some hot 
water.. 
&gt; Could barely open the doors and cut my finger a bit yanking it 
open, 
&gt; but the windows were sealed shut... I was totally stupid to not 
just 
&gt; call in and say I'd be late by 10 minutes but I guess I was really 

&gt; worried I'd get fired (by bozo) so I drove with all the windows 
&gt; closed and all the carbon monoxide killing my brain cells...
&gt; I'm getting it taken care of very soon...
&gt; Meanwhile, I really don't feel up to doing anything right now, and 

I 
&gt; was just going to skip it, but I'm starting to feel sad about 
&gt; breaking my own promise to myself and my fellow metalheads, so I 
am 
&gt; going to do my SG anyways!
&gt; Probably I will go at a snails pace.. I feel like I've been 
&gt; drugged... And not the good kind of drugged!
&gt; As for tomorrow.. I am getting out the door way earlier to make 
sure 
&gt; I can get those windows open.
&gt; I hope you are all doing well and please send me a little prayer 
cuz 
&gt; today I just need it folks... Just one of those days...
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Deb

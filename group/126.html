As the proud owner of a frozen shoulder (brought on by rotator cuff 
damage from repetitive motion), I would caution you against doing a 
whole lot of fixed position overhead work. The shoulder is stablized 
by a bunch of small muscles and soft tissue that is fairly easy to 
damage. It doesn't like overhead, repetitive motion. Do it slowly and 
gently, and try not to get in a &quot;groove&quot;. Move it a little forward 

and a little backwards.

I can't even do levers because the stress on my bad shoulder is too 
focused and repeated. I do a motion I call &quot;breaking ice&quot;, with the 

sledge held in one hand, head down, and brought up and down like I'm, 
well, breaking ice. I involve my legs and back and move the sledge a 
little forward and backwards with each stroke so I don't get into too 
fixed a movement. Sometimes I raise it all the way above my head, 
sometimes not.

Another move that'll really get you breathing is &quot;pick up the 
pieces&quot;. Full depth squats. I alternate hands on the sledge with the 

head resting on the floor to steady me (like a cane). Squat all the 
way down like you are picking up mined diamonds or something. I do 
sets of 100, but start with 15 or 25 slow ones. Feet flat on the 
floor in the up position, on your toes in the lower position. Your 
knees will complain a bit at first, but in a few weeks they'll feel 
absolutely great. There is nothing like this for developing stamina. 
Nothing. And you can think of it as part of your &quot;working&quot; routine. I 

do these after the splitting wood motion (my scenario is mining, so I 
think of this as a picking the ore vein rather than splitting wood).

If you're looking for more motions, think manual labor. You can do 
raking, variations on shoveling, pickaxe-ing, tree chopping, etc. 
Reinhard's are a terrific start - and I have a warm place in my heart 
for him for getting me started, but run your own scenario. (Like I 
said, my head-game is mining).

One of the beauty parts of shovelglove, in my opinion, is that the 
movements are whole body movements that de-isolate muscle groups, 
minimizing repetitive motion injury.

Anyway, one man's humble opinion.

&gt; Hi. I have a question about a movement. I am guessing
&gt; it is similar to flip the lever, but not sure. I hold
&gt; the sledge above my head, one hand one each end. the
&gt; hand closest to the weight pumps up and down as if i
&gt; was doing the pumping of oil out of the ground. Anyone
&gt; have any thoughts on this, if it's bad, if they've
&gt; tried it? I'm trying to get a routine of movements
&gt; down.. I end up coming up short of my minutes. I've
&gt; finally worked my way up to 14 minutes without dying
&gt; and would like to maintain that. Anyone have any other
&gt; sets they can post. I do most of the ones johnny vague
&gt; posted. 
&gt; Reinhard.. you could do a shovelglove video to follow
&gt; along with for the beginners

Guys it is bizarre how my mind works (incase any of you are laughing 
at lil'ol me for that blatantly obvious news, shut it! LOL )
I almost convinced myself that my arms were too sore for my 
workout...but as usual once I turned on my tunes and took less than 
3 swings I was having a ball...It's pathetic how much negativity is 
in what Reinhard would call my &quot;sneaky mind&quot;... Really it's just a 

mental drain... Once I got revved up by about 6 minutes in, I 
realized that my soreness was *because* of SG...So I guess it's true 
what they say, cliched or not, no pain no gain... In light of this, 
I welcome future soreness, and as long as my strength is still good 
and I'm not *really* uncomfortable on a much different level of 
pain, next time I hear my preliminary mental whining &quot;I'm sore 
today&quot; or &quot;my shoulder tendinitis is acting up&quot; etc...I will retort 

to my mind with
&quot;TOUGH SH!T start moving you baby!&quot; LOL

Today I had my usual startup with the Dead, and then I decided to 
end with some seriously inspiring SG music,,,,
John McLaughlin and Remember Shakti
Sick stuff guys! Totally sick....
I created a new move. Well not really new. Actually I've been 
doing it for quite some weeks now, but can't quite think of an easy 
description. It would be so much fun to have some way of taking a 
picture of this, but no camera yet... I'll try to think of how to 
describe it and maybe post it on the &quot;moves&quot; folder :)
Okay, Joe is excused today for Swednesday but the rest of you aren't!
Ten hut! (LOL forgive my stupidity, I am in such a great mood, I 
can't help it!)
Peace,
Deb

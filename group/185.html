Hi Lee,

Don't get thrown by all this 20 pound sledge talk. 8
pounds is plenty. This isn't a contest. You might even
want to consider a lighter one. To run (perhaps in
another direction) with Deb's spinal tap reference,
it's better to work out at &quot;9,&quot; than &quot;11.&quot;

The single most important thing is just to carve out
the time, 14 minutes every non-S-day. Like the
nosdiet, it's mostly about habit. Even if you stood
around doing nothing until the alarm rang, it'd be
progress. Remember: the only hard parameter is the
time, you don't have to do particular movements or
number of reps. If you're feeling tired, take it slow,
ridiculously slow, if you have to. The session is over
when the alarm rings. It's not a goal you have to
struggle towards, it just comes. 

&quot;Come what come may, time and the hour rides through
the roughest day.&quot; -- Macbeth

I find that I've never stopped a routine once I'd
started, so just start. Excuses never occur to you
once you've started, only before. I've never once
regretted taking the time to shovelglove. I always
regret not doing it on those rare days when I miss a
session. 

Oh, and funny as it is that you're not telling your
husband, I would. Stealth just gives you one more
excuse to skip out.

Don't worry about arms vs. abs. Think of it this way:
the arms are the tools that shape the abs, you shape
them first. Or more precisely, the ab shaping tool
requires (and builds) strong arms. I don't do any
other exercise (except walk), and I'm pretty happy
with my abs. Yes, it took a while, but you have a
while, and it lasts.

Best of luck,

Reinhard

&gt; Well, I did get a sledgehammer yesterday. My
&gt; husband's was just too 
&gt; heavy. I only got an 8 lb one and for me it is
&gt; heavy. WOW. It was 
&gt; hard. By the end I was going so slow. I started
&gt; before I got the 
&gt; hammer with an empty cue stick case. That was way
&gt; too easy but it 
&gt; gave me practice with the motions. Now that I have
&gt; the hammer, what 
&gt; a difference the workout is. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am mainly feeling it in my arms today. My main
&gt; problem area, 
&gt; since I am a woman, is the stomach and hips. I am
&gt; following your 
&gt; chart.
&gt; 
&gt; How is the baby? Is she home yet?

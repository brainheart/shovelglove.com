Hi guys. Just wanted to let you know my SGing is still going well. I 
think I did it 3 or 4 times last week after &quot;graduating&quot; from the 

broom. It was really starting to feel good, and probably I'm
imagining this but I was starting to feel stronger by Friday. This 
isn't possible, right? Anyway, it's fun and that's the good thing!! 
BTW, a tip for anyone who's interested: when my arms get too tired 
to continue the usual movements, I just put the SG on one shoulder 
and do squats for awhile. A great workout on the legs and gives the 
arms a rest. I know it's not really a &quot;useful movement&quot;, but I have 

to compromise a bit :)

On the down side, I have a sore/stiff neck today from too much yard 
work yesterday (mostly weeding flowerbeds, which involved a lot of 
bending over). Hope it doesn't interfere with my workout this
evening. This is so bizarre - I've never &quot;injured&quot; myself from 

physical activity before, and now I've done it twice in one month. 
sigh. Really makes me feel old, and I'm 27. oh well, that's 
precisely why I'm trying to get more exercise in my life. Wish me 
luck tonight. 

Deb, I hope you're feeling better now! Did you have a good Easter 
weekend?

-Ariel

PS - Reinhard, thanks for nipping that ugly thread in the bud.

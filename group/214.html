all set. Still, less pain and and more strength is better. One 
should be grateful.&quot;

*Warning this is not about Shovelglove per se, just the muscles 
folks, feel free to skip it if not of personal interest :)

Hey Kevin :)
Yes you are right about less pain being a good sign...Have you 
considered getting a good massage to help resolve whatever trigger 
points, and tendinitis that may still remain? They usually go hand 
in hand.
Passive and PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation)
stretching with a therapist who is good at Sports type techniques is 
very effective to help you with ROM...But as far as rehabilitation 
and realistic expectations, don't be surprised if you have lingering 
stuff for up to a whole year...I'm not trying to bum you out, but 
real injuries have a tendency to cause muscle splinting and usually 
trigger points develop. We use the shoulder *all* the time and it 
cant just stay in a sling forever, so it will take some time to 
really recover and heal, but even after the healing stage, it can 
have limited function, due to these trigger points. No problem 
until you go and put the muscle under load (sledgehammers are 
definitely load) and also if you stretch the compromised muscle it 
will instigate a pain response...Plus the really sucky thing about 
trigger points, is that they not only hurt, but can reduce the 
muscles strength considerably, as I said in a previous post, I am 
becoming a lefty for some things these days. The constant 
contraction can cause the whole muscle to have less ROM, you mention 
rotator cuff but consider maybe that you might have hurt the long 
head of the biceps as well, even though that is technically not 
a &quot;cuff&quot; muscle, it can get clipped pretty nicely too and hurt alot 

at the anterior shoulder...I am taking a wild guess and please 
correct me if I am wrong, but did you hurt either
A. Supraspinatus or 
B. Infraspinatus
these are very commonly hurt because they are small and we use them 
all of the time which can really fatigue them
or 
C...I don't have a clue, LOL
If your answer is C, it is time to go to a massage therapist who 
knows how to do muscle length testing, knows how to do Sports 
massage and can deactivate your trigger points.
If you lived on Long Island I would encourage you to come to my 
office, but I guess you will have to find someone up there wherever 
you are in the World (just make sure they are licensed and good)
I hope you continue to improve on your health path :)
When your shoulder really acts up, try to use contrast bathing which 
is 1 or 2 minutes of circular ice massage to the junction where you 
have the tenderness, then use a warm, not scalding, heat compress, 
or warm shower water, for about 3 minutes, then go back to the ice 
for a few minutes...you can do this 3 or 4 times...Always end with 
ice to reduce tissue fluid loss in the muscle, otherwise you may 
wind up even *more* sore...This technique brings fresh blood to the 
area and pumps out the metabolic &quot;crap&quot; that builds up in the 

tissues...You may scream at first when you use the ice, but it does 
eventually have an analgesic effect and will be very helpful, 
especially after working out...I do it whenever my arms feel too 
full and I have been doing lots of massage, it flushes them and they 
feel really good after. If you already know about any of this, 
forgive me for assuming you don't...
Have a nice rainy day, it's pouring down here in NY too :)

Time to wield the axe!
Peace and Love
Debbie

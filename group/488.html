Yeah it is cool how everyday items , in my case
securing reinforced steel doors, when i worked at a
correctional facility. Exercise just improves the
qaulity of life. I love that part in the movie &quot;13th
warrior when banderas is given a broadsword by one of
the Norsemen and he says &quot;I cannot lift this!&quot; The
Norseman quips &quot;Grow stronger.&quot; or did we discuss that
one allready. I cant keep everything straight sorry.

&gt; Ha ha! Well being around this group of &quot;workout
&gt; artists&quot; has been 
&gt; very inspiring to say the least :) When I went into
&gt; the repair shop 
&gt; yesterday to get my car inspected, I had a brilliant
&gt; flash of 
&gt; inspiration, whilst gazing at the dumpster....
&gt; Tires! Mountains and mountains of tires waiting to
&gt; find an adoptive 
&gt; parent who would abuse them! (sorry adoption parents
&gt; out there. heh)
&gt; I am now the proud recipient of pickup truck tire
&gt; which used to 
&gt; belong to a Dodge Ram extended cab pickup....
&gt; The name on the sidewalls of this rubber smashing
&gt; block, I found to 
&gt; be very appropriate, considering I will be beating
&gt; the living 
&gt; daylights out of it once the snow melts around
&gt; here,,,,
&gt; &quot;Hercules&quot; LOL :)
&gt; So in honor of George Washington week, &quot;I cannot
&gt; tell a lie&quot; I 
&gt; skipped Shovelglove yesterday... There's really no
&gt; good reason for 
&gt; this so I plan on kicking my own ass today as
&gt; penance...
&gt; However I did go shopping today and, I will say that
&gt; I had quite a 
&gt; good little &quot;in store&quot; workout... It was one of
&gt; those riduculously 
&gt; huge supermarkets, and I never go there... So I was
&gt; wandering around 
&gt; lost like Mick Jones.... and it took some time to
&gt; gather what I was 
&gt; looking for... I didn't use a cart and carried
&gt; everything in a 
&gt; basket instead...Got some somewhat heavy items and
&gt; by the end of the 
&gt; shop I would say the basket had to weigh 30 lbs, and
&gt; the whole 
&gt; basket was buckling and seemed like it would
&gt; separate from the metal 
&gt; handles! LOL :).... I was proud of my 
&gt; Shovelglove enhanced grocery carrying prowess!
&gt; LOL :) Maybe this one should be added to your
&gt; everydaysystems eh 
&gt; Rein? You know a, grab whatever you can that's
&gt; around and carry it 
&gt; for 14 minutes whenever an opportunity presents
&gt; itself, kind of 
&gt; thing.. even if it's not in a sweater :) 
&gt; (That is unless they are cute!)
&gt; Cheers all :)
&gt; Warrior Deb,
&gt; Lifter of the Heavy cans 
&gt; and Large containers of Milk.... 
&gt; I will be doing my SG now though... Here I go :)

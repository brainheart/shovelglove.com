Allan,

I've added a section describing/linking to your
&quot;scenario based shovelglove&quot; posts to the home page:

<a href="http://www.shovelglove.com/#scenario">http://www.shovelglove.com/#scenario</a>

I'm amazed at how much you're able to come up with for
each scenario and how natural and uncontrived the
movements are. One thing just leads to the next. You
are &quot;obligated&quot; to &quot;finish him.&quot; I love it.

I have to give this a try this week, but without any
kids yet to sound my ideas off of, I'm afraid I'll be
at a competitive disadvantage :-). They've got such a
good ear for this kind of thing.

Keep posting. This stuff is great.

Reinhard

&gt; Friday's shovelglove workout was &quot;preparing the
&gt; defenses.&quot; Yesterday's was &quot;defending the walls.&quot;
&gt; Only
&gt; made sense since we spent the day before preparing
&gt; for
&gt; an attack &lt;grin.&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Note: the 4 lb. sledge is really just a large hammer
&gt; but it seems to fit my 11 year old easily enough. A
&gt; 6
&gt; lb would be more ideal but we couldn't find one.
&gt; 
&gt; First, we manned the walls with bow and arrow. We
&gt; &quot;shot the bow&quot; 10x each side. This was done by
&gt; simulating shooting a bow at an extremely high arc,
&gt; with the hand pulling the bowstring holding the
&gt; shovelglove. I had to hold it very near the head as
&gt; even 10 lber became extremely heavy after only a
&gt; couple repetitions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then, as the enemy drew closer to the walls, we
&gt; &quot;shot
&gt; the bow point blank,&quot; 10x each side. This was done
&gt; by
&gt; lowering the bow from a high 45* angle to a 90*
&gt; angle,
&gt; held directly in front of you as though you were,
&gt; you
&gt; guessed it, shooting an arrow point blank. 
&gt; 
&gt; The enemy then mounted ladders and attempted to
&gt; scale
&gt; the walls. We defeated them by.. well I couldn't
&gt; come
&gt; up with a name for it, but what we did was use the
&gt; &quot;stoke the fire,&quot; or &quot;spear thrust,&quot; movement 
to
&gt; knock
&gt; the enemy off the wall. We completed the movement by
&gt; drawing the shovelglove back, lifting the front
&gt; foot,
&gt; and thrusting the sledge forward with a stamp of the
&gt; foot. We did this one 10x each side. 
&gt; 
&gt; The walls were breached so we had to take it hand to
&gt; hand. First, we did 20x &quot;smite the orcs,&quot; better
&gt; known as &quot;chopping the tree,&quot; with each side. Then,
&gt; we
&gt; did a similar movement but brought the shovelglove
&gt; from directly overhead, instead of diagonally as in
&gt; the 'chopping tree' movement. This we did 10x,
&gt; changed
&gt; grip and did another 10. This will really burn your
&gt; triceps quick. 
&gt; 
&gt; We were getting overrun and our lines had crumbled,
&gt; so
&gt; it was everyman for himself. I kept the enemy at bay
&gt; using the &quot;whirling berserker&quot; movement. Imagine
&gt; Babe
&gt; Ruth at a home run derby - I just swung the
&gt; shovelglove directly in front of me side to side,
&gt; with
&gt; a lot of power. WARNING - DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SWING
&gt; HARD
&gt; AND HALT THE MOVEMENT OF THE SHOVELGLOVE. You will
&gt; injure your joints and tendons in no time flat. If
&gt; you
&gt; use this move, just follow through as though you are
&gt; swinging a heavy baseball bat. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had initially performed this movement just like a
&gt; bat, dropping my hands closer together doing the
&gt; movement and even finishing the move with one hand.
&gt; But I personally felt best just keeping both hands
&gt; on
&gt; the shovelglove and rotating the hands as the swing
&gt; passes in front of you mid-point. This is a very
&gt; natural movement (at least I thought so) and didn't
&gt; require a lot of thought once I just let my body
&gt; handle the details. 
&gt; 
&gt; I did 20x, then switched grip and did another 20x. I
&gt; counted one swing and back as one repetition.
&gt; 
&gt; Whew! We finally repelled the enemy and now had to
&gt; scour the battlefield for survivors. (The squeamish
&gt; among you may prefer to skip this part.) We did
&gt; &quot;finish him&quot; 20x, using a movement akin to 'churning
&gt; butter' or 'tamping the dirt,' only with the
&gt; shovelglove held closer to the ground. You bring it
&gt; up
&gt; vigorously overhead and thrust it down vigorously,
&gt; as
&gt; though you were, well, trying to finish of the bad
&gt; guy. Since we workout outside we actually thumped
&gt; the
&gt; shovelglove onto the ground, but indoors just raise
&gt; and lower the shovelglove in a more controlled
&gt; movement. 
&gt; 
&gt; Total time was about 14-15 minutes, but we were
&gt; moving
&gt; at a quick pace. And all the celebrating and
&gt; saluting
&gt; movements from Friday's workout? Well, add them if
&gt; you
&gt; can but I could barely raise my arms when we were
&gt; done, lol! I imagined the king was still hiding in
&gt; his
&gt; bunker anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; So there you have it, our second 'scenario based
&gt; shovelglove' workout. I haven't thought of what I'll
&gt; do next, any ideas please let me know!
&gt; 
&gt; - Allan

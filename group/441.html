Guten Morgen Mathilda! How is your Hunship this
morning ? I Had a good SG WO this morning as well. A
massage therapist i could have used your help after
some of the MA classes i've had in my life...lol. As a
2nd language teacher did you have to know Spanish in
particular or what other languages? I mutilate German
sometimes and have Berlitz CD's on Portugese and
Russian. Years ago 1986 i was in the Army and worked
supply warehouses that got me interested in weight tng
..funny how sundry items get heavier as the day goes
on eh? Yes, you don't have to pepper spray computers
like you do convicts (sometimes the temptation is
there though lol) I worked down here in TX, for TDC.
The closest i've been to Rikers is watching the cops
on Law and Order interrogate a perp on that show. :)
Dont feel bad my 1st fiance so many years ago ran off
w/ my money and ended up in jail later on drug
charges...a stripper from Dallas...guess everyone baks
the wrong pony once in a while. Guitar Huh? Play some
Led Zepellin! NOW!. What type of music do you like
..my tastes are kind of eclectic. Rock, reggae, Blues,
Jazz, some new stuff like Otmar Leibert and Luna
Negra, not really new huh? Robert Kray from Houston is
great.
Well..Woddy Allen was great in Sleeper and Going
Bannanas (sp) I realy love Guy Ritchie movies &quot;Lock
Stock and two smoking barrels&quot; is priceless. Jason
Statham is one of favorite actors...after Bobby DeNiro
of course. Well better go im going to try and make
gaspacho...gaspachio ...gaspzkio...gasparkio...cold
Tomatoe soup. Have a better one Deb!
Richard.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Deb for the reply and the e-card!
&gt; &gt; Bueller..Ferris Bueller from the movie when Ben
&gt; Stein
&gt; &gt; is taking roll in class. What sort of work do you
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; Deb?
&gt; .... I am a massage therapist now, but in past lives
&gt; I worked as an 
&gt; English as a Second Language teacher, substitute
&gt; teacher in public 
&gt; school, various and sundry other crummy jobs and
&gt; deluxe auto part 
&gt; delivery girl! :) I guess that primed me for
&gt; Shovelglove since I 
&gt; was carrying around disc brakes, car batteries, and
&gt; mufflers! :)
&gt; Thank goodness I finally found something I really
&gt; love doing...
&gt; My first degree was in Music though and I still sing
&gt; and play guitar 
&gt; with my little Richard (he is neither Loki nor
&gt; Tyrus, just Cute-us)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I worked in Corrections for over 10 years...
&gt; ....Gee I wonder if you ever ran into one of my last
&gt; &quot;winner&quot; 
&gt; boyfriends who spent 5 years on Rikers Island? 
&gt; Great taste huh? 
&gt; LOL :)
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; i went to school to study Computer Networks now i
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; help desk tech support and fix comps out of my
&gt; house.
&gt; ....Good job eh? Better than riot control :)
&gt; Now, I can see why you may have chosen to take up
&gt; Kettlebells and 
&gt; SG,,, Self preservation! LOL :)
&gt; Hey the worst thing a computer can do to you is get
&gt; you pissed when 
&gt; it has a virus, it's not trying to bust a cap in
&gt; your ass...Hey did 
&gt; you ever see that funny Woody Allen movie &quot;Take the
&gt; Money and Run?&quot; 
&gt; I liked when he made a gun out of soap and shoe
&gt; polish and then it 
&gt; foamed up when he tried to use it on the guards in a
&gt; rain storm! LOL!
&gt; Remember to sleep late tomorrow :)
&gt; Deb
&gt; PS... I did a great Sg routine tonight and became
&gt; Mathilda the Hun :)
&gt;

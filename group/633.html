&gt; Ohh, Athena. Nice strong name yah. Anyway... (Wow, I am goofy 
&gt; today)

...Hi Nay! I think Athena is a great name!!! Don't worry about 
goofiness, we all are a bunch of goofballs (especially yours truly!)
Here's a suggestion as far as getting yourself to do your workout 
everyday: Find your absolute favorite &quot;move it&quot; songs to get 

yourself pumped up. I'm sure you're hungry when you get home, so 
I'm not going to suggest you do the workout before dinner (although 
if you are just waiting for the shake and bake to finish cooking, 
you could do SG while waiting for your food to cook!)
I find that once my songs are on, it's just like the Pavlov's dog 
story, Reinhard mentions on his main site... I associate working out 
with those songs, and when they are on, it's like a cry that must be 
answered!!!
If you feel wimpy, then just do it &quot;half steam&quot;.. I guarantee that 

you will feel great that you kept your commitment to yourself and 
your 14 minutes of POWER!!! 
Hey I know you aren't going to sleep right after dinner, so no more 
excuses okay! If you need to, do it instead of watching tv... If 
you like doing it, you'll find a means to do it! :)
I am thrilled at the increasing number of &quot;Pact Sisters&quot; that are in 

Shovelglove now... If you stick with this, you will become addicted, 
so give yourself a cheer everytime you do it and good luck!
What moves do you like to do so far? I wanna see Athena bust some 
heads okay! :) Keep it up!
Love,
Deb
Founder of the Pact of Blood
NY Shovelglove Warriors

&gt; I'm glad you liked it, but it looks like 1290 people got to the

....It's not just the term. It's the way that you used it! LOL :)

&gt; I'm really pressed for time right now and make it a point to 
actually practice my systems before writing about them :-). The 
practice part is going well,
.....Yay Rein! No sweat, we all benefit from having a brainy guinea 
pig (without the beady little eyes and small feet) to do the 
clinical &quot;trials&quot; for us before the product hits the market! Thanks 

for that, fluffy :)

Diddling on the internet is hard to make a priority... and the 
groups seem to have gotten pretty self sustaining without me 
constantly posting....do spend a fair amount of time diddling with, 
and will be heavily optimized for me to do maximum &quot;blog&quot; in minimum 

time).

...Yeh, diddling is what I have been doing a lot of lately, I guess 
it's a weakness of mine.. Maybe if I was as busy with work it would 
be different...but, constant posting? Fuggedaboudit, just one of 
your posts is enough to sustain at least a month of SG for 
me...lot's of fun reading your ideas...No pressure just applause for 
your unique way of seeing and writing about things :)

&gt; Hey, 2005 isn't over. I have an idea for this year's shot that 
requires some more procrastination and a little extra capital 
expenditure.

....LOL! It'll be a sleeper classic, I tell you... and don't 
forget,,,Chippendales is hiring. They just throw money at you you 
know :)
(just kidding hee hee)
Alright that's enough diddling for now!
(note to self: get some more coffee and then diddle for a couple 
more minutes...then SG :-) ....)
Oh here's a weird link for you.... found it on that Google search 
page you posted Rein..
If any of you suffer from 4 out of 5 of these symptoms, get some 
help, or some Valvoline...
<a href="http://www.vtpi.org/autosex.htm">http://www.vtpi.org/autosex.htm</a>
&gt; P.S. Thanks for the stretch info. I do pay pretty close attention 

to my body, so if anything feels slightly out of whack, I'll give it 
a closer read. I still can't get over 1) how fine I feel without 
stretching 2) how there is no &quot;everyday&quot; precedent for it in the 

daily routines of our hunter/farmer/homemaker ancestors, so far as 
I'm aware (the question wasn't entirely rhetorical).
....What? I though Australopithacus started PNF! I guess I was 
wrong :) You know I was just yanking your rhetorical chain Rein :)
Just sounded like an excuse to me! LOL :)
Peace and Happy Shovelling All,
Enjoy your weekend,
Deb :)

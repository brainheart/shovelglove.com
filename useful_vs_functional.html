<p><i>The following was lifted from a post buried in a thread <a

<p>
I'm very happy to see "functional exercise" catching on vs. cosmetic
exercise. But here's one issue I have with the movements described in
<a
href="http://outside.away.com/outside/bodywork/200206/200206_shape_of_your_life_month2.html">this article</a> and that I've read about in other places: it's
still all about muscle, not about mind. The movements may train real
muscles, but they don't do so in a real way. And that real way,
something that feels like a useful movement, is what makes the
exercise fun, and that, to me, is more important than mere
physiological effectiveness -- because otherwise I wouldn't keep doing
them, and then who cares how effective they are. The article shows
these pictures of this surfer dude lugging a log around, but that's
just for show: the actual recommended movements are contrived and
gym-like.
<p>

<p>
I came up with the term "useful movements" before I'd ever heard of
"functional exercise," and I guess this is the distinction:
</p>

<p>
"Functional exercise" builds muscles for a real world function. But
the exercises often look and feel nothing like the real world
movements they are training you for.
</p>

<p>"Useful movements" exercise muscles by mimicking real world
function. Every exercise looks and feels like a real world
movement. This may be less efficient, physiologically, but it's more
fun.</p>

<p>I guess you could consider "useful movements" a subset of
"functional exercise." They are functional exercises that keep the
<em>form</em> of the original movement.</p>

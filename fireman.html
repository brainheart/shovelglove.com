<h1><a href="/">Shovelglove</a> : Movements : Fireman</h1>

<p><a href="/nickelodeon.cgi?m=fireman&amp;x=75">See video and stills</a></p>

<p>This move is simple and somewhat less contrived than most: imagine
you are a firefighter chopping down a door.</p>

<p>I call it the fire<em>man</em> rather than the
fire<em>fighter</em>, not because I am a sexist brute, but because
this is the most testosterone laden of moves and I wanted to emphasize
that fact.</p>

<p>Middle-earth fans may prefer to think of it as "smite the orc," an
image which suggests the movement admirably.</p>

<p>Interesting aside: while I can't claim they do shovelglove, many <a
href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/shovelglove/message/29">fire
departments do use sledgehammers</a> in their training programs.</p>

<p>Note: I've stopped doing this movement regularly because I think it
might perhaps unduly strain the back. This may just be my imagination,
but I prefer to be cautious.</p>

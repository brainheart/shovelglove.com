<h1><a href="/">Shovelglove</a> : Movements : Tuck Bales</h1>

<p><a href="/nickelodeon.cgi?m=tuck_bales&amp;x=39">See video and stills</a></p>

<p>This is such a hopelessly inadequate term for this movement that I
can't find a single google hit for <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22tuck+bales%22&btnG=Google+Search">"tuck
bales"</a>. One <em>pitches</em> bales, one does not <em>tuck</em>
them. But "pitch" is wrong for what I have in mind here. It's based on
something I remember having seen my grandfather and uncle (actual
farmers) do. The idea is, you've got these rectangular bales of hay
that need to be stacked high up in the barn. To do this, you spend a
fair amount of time jabbing upward with a pitchfork. That's the
movement.</p>

<p>"Smash the ceiling" might have been a more descriptive name, but
it's not quite in character. It's essentially a reverse <a
href="churn_butter.html">butter churn</a>.</p>

<p>Note: it helps to have really high ceilings for this, or you really
might smash them.</p>

<p>What muscles does this hit? Oh, a bunch, like all the
movements. But it feels to me like most especially the shoulders and
neck.</p>

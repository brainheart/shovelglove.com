<h1><a href="/">Shovelglove</a> : Movements : Flip the Lever (formerly The Movement with No Name)</h1>

<p><a href="/nickelodeon.cgi?m=flip_lever&amp;x=50">See video and stills</a></p>

<p>This is kind of like a curl, with extra emphasis on the
forearm.</p>

<p>Hold the shovelglove parallel to your arm. Grab it so the end of
the shaft is near your elbow. Slack your arm so the shovelglove head
is just above your foot, shaft parallel to your leg. Raise the head
until it's 90 degrees, straight out in front of
you. Lower. Repeat.</p>

<p>My whole body swings too, don't worry about it.</p>

<p>Ryan Ware has suggested an alternate name for this movement: curl
swings. I like it because it describes the physical process well (not
so metaphorical, though). So "no name" now has three names (counting
"no name")! Thanks, Ryan!</p>

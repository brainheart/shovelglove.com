<h2>How to Make and Use a Shovelglove</h2>



<div style="float: right; margin: 5px; ">



</div>

<p>Take a sledgehammer and wrap an old sweater around it. This is your
"shovelglove." Every week day morning, set a timer for 14 minutes. Use
the shovelglove to perform shoveling, butter churning, and other
movements inspired by traditional manual labor until the timer goes
off. Stop. Rest on weekends and holidays.</p>

<p>The number and the order of the movements is flexible. Do them at
the pace and in the order that feels right to you. Pay careful
attention to your form, so as not to strain yourself. Imagine that you
really are performing the activities being simulated. The critical
thing is to do it every weekday, no more, no less; for 14 minutes, no
more, no less; in a careful, non spastic manner.</p>

<h2>The Story of Shovelglove</h2>

<p>I don't know how to explain shovelglove without going into the
story of it's genesis, so here goes. Pretty pictures and a spell-checker
will eventually grace this site, but don't hold your breath.</p>

<p>It was a rainy Sunday. I hadn't gone to the gym in over three
months, and I was feeling painfully out of shape and antsy to do some
kind of exercise. But I didn't want to go out in the rain, and the
prospect of subjecting myself to the boring torture of the gym seemed
even drearier. I wanted an exercise I could do right there, in my
bedroom, without any fancy equipment.</p>

<p>But I didn't want to do sit-ups or pushups. I didn't want to grovel
on my stomach on the floor, like some degraded beast. "There must be
some kind of movement I can do standing up, with the dignity of a
human being," I thought, "some kind of movement that is natural and
interesting, that my body would <i>like</i> to do." </p>

<p>I started making all kinds of spastic movements, hoping to come
across something that resonated. I remembered reading something in
some French novel about coal shovelers having the best abdominal
muscles of anyone the author had ever seen. I started making shoveling
motions. </p>

<p>Now there are a few problems with shoveling, from an exercise
perspective. For one, if I actually went outside and started
shoveling, I'd get all wet (remember, it's raining). The neighbors
would think I was crazy, and if I did it at the wrong time I'd
actually annoy them. I'd also have to have something to shovel, a
waste of space, at least (our backyard is more of back alley). So
outdoors is out. But I couldn't really shovel indoors, either. Even if
I just did a pantomime with a shovel, I'd need some kind of weight to
move, and I'd need some way of keeping it from scratching the floors
or killing the cats.</p>

<p>That's when it occurred to me: what I needed was a shovel with a
weight attached to it, and a fuzzy glove to keep it from scratching
the floors or killing the cats. At first I thought I'd call it "fuzzy
shovel," but "shovelglove" seemed catchier.</p>

<p>Now I had to make the darn thing. I went to the local hardware
store, and after some experimenting, I wound up with something that
worked: a sledgehammer with an old sweater wrapped around it. It had
the right shape, just enough weight, and the requisite softness. And
it was pleasingly simple.</p>

<h2>Useful Movements</h2>

<p>Other movements besides shoveling occurred to me. My chief criterion
was they had to have a natural analog, some useful movement that human
beings had historically performed during the course of their ordinary
daily activities. My hypothesis was that these movements would be
inherently interesting to perform, develop muscles that might actually
come in handy (God forbid you should actually have to shovel
something), and relatively safe. These are the movements we were made
for, after all, the movements that enabled us to survive. They might
not target specific muscles quite as efficiently as the contrived
motions of the gym, but that seemed to me a vastly less important
consideration; what you won't do -- because it is painfully boring --
won't help you.</p>

<p>The second criterion was that the movements had to be performed
standing up. The first criterion pretty much makes this a given,
historically people haven't done a whole lot of work lying down, but I
feel that erect posture is important enough to deserve its own
particular emphasis. Before we were <i>Homo sapiens</i>, we were
<i>Homo habilis</i>, the tool user, and before we were <i>Homo
habilus</i>, we were <i>Homo erectus</i>, men who stood up. A great
deal of pompous smarmy nonsense has been written about what makes us
human, but these two attributes go even deeper, they make us
pre-human. They distinguished us from our bestial brethren before we
had sufficient brains to make more impressive but less accurate
distinctions. And I firmly believe that you will feel better about
whatever it is you are doing (with a couple of obvious exceptions) if
you do it standing up.</p>

<p>The third criterion was that the movements had to be convenient to
perform in a modern living room. Plowing fields passes the above criteria
with flying colors, but I haven't (yet) figured out a way to plow a
field short of actually plowing a field.</p>

<p>I call these movements, "useful movements," because that's what
they are, at least potentially. There are three that I perform using
the shovelglove. There's a fourth movement for which I haven't found a
natural analog yet, but I enjoy it, and consistency is a boring
virtue.</p>

<p>The original movements were: <a
href="movements/shovel/">shoveling</a>, <a
href="movements/churn_butter/">churning butter</a>, and <a
href="movements/chop_wood/">chopping wood</a>. And the <a
href="movements/flip_lever/">movement with no name</a>, of
course. I've added a bunch more over the years, and you can see the
ones I've stuck with listed in this central <a
href="movements/">movement registry</a>.</p>

<p>The trick is to really imagine yourself doing them -- really
shoveling, really chopping wood. It'll keep you interested, and it'll
keep your form good. Proper form is important, or you'll mess up your
back. I wish I could concoct some dream exercise that could dispense
with the complexities of form, but I don't think there is any such
thing. But view it as a perk, the byproduct of this attention is
interest, and it comes easily if you buy into the analogy. It's play,
after all.</p>

<p>All the movement description pages now contain youtube movies of me
doing them, since it's possible that you are so alienated from the
movements of your ancestors that the phrase "chopping wood" doesn't
mean a whole lot to you.</p>

<p>I like to think the idea of useful movements has some precedent:
the martial arts. I'm no martial arts expert, but remember all that
"wax the fence" business from the Karate Kid. </p>

<h2>Schedulistically Significant Time</h2>

<p>So I had the tools, and I had the movements, the "what" and the
"how." All I needed was a "when."</p>

<p>The "when" is perhaps the most satisfying component of this system:
14 minutes every weekday. Rest on weekends and holidays.</p>

<p>You guessed it, 14 is a significant number. Why? Because it's one
minute less than the smallest unit of <b>schedulistically significant
time</b>. No calendar has a finer granularity than 15 minutes. No one
ever has a meeting that starts at 5 or 10 or 14 minutes before or
after the hour. You have no excuse not to do this. Time-wise, it
doesn't even register.</p>

<p>Yet it is just long enough to give some aerobic benefit. Yes, half
an hour would be better. An hour would be even better. But guess what?
You won't do it. You might do it for 3 weeks, or maybe even 3 months,
but you'll start to resent it and you'll quit. Do it for 14 minutes
and you'll do it for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Respect the timer. When it goes off, you stop. It doesn't matter if
you have a few reps left in your set. The sets and reps are just
guidelines, the timer is the only hard parameter. Don't feel like you
are doing something good, something extra, by continuing. You're just
establishing a dangerous precedent which will make you that much less
likely to start shovelgloving again the next time. By dragging the
routine into schedulistic significance, you are just setting yourself
up with a good excuse to skip it.</p>

<p>You are doing this for the long run. The goal is to form a lifelong
habit, not to burn a few extra calories today. 14 minutes is habit
friendly, and excuse proof. And 14 minutes will burn enough calories,
build enough muscle, for long term health.</p>

<p>Don't look at the timer, that will drive you crazy. Just wait for
the beep to go off. Extending the labor metaphor, think of it as the
overseer's whistle.</p>

<p>Not exercising on weekends and holidays has several benefits. Your
body needs rest. You get to enjoy your time off. And you're much less
likely to take trips that interfere with your exercise schedule. It'll
still happen, but (unless you travel a lot for business) less
frequently. And who is really going to exercise on Christmas or
Thanksgivings (or your religio-cultural equivalents)? You might as well
make it official and spare yourself needless guilt.</p>

<p>I've found, through much trial and error, that mornings, before
work, are best for me. Once I take that first swing, I get completely
into it, and go to work feeling like a superman. But convincing my
groggy morning self to take that first swing can be tricky. I have had
a very high success rate by putting on shovelglove mood music right
before exercising. Once the music and the habit become initimately
associated, it's almost impossible to resist. I don't know if it's
important what you use for mood music, but I think it is important
that it be the same, or drawn from a very small repetoire, every
time. Pavlov's dog won't drool to just any bell, right? I use a <a
href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/349191034X/qid=1037573142/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/302-8298731-8846460">
musical rendition</a> of a <a
href="http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/hoffmanh/struwwel/struwwel.htm">
sadistic 19th century German children's book</a>, which I acknowledge,
is a little demented, but boy does it get me going.</p>

<h2><a id="progress_trap"></a>The Progress Trap</h2>

<p>Don't worry about progress. People tend to be so obsessed with
progress that they quit exercise routines after a few months, when
they're done making rapid gains. They exercise for 6 months, get bored
and frustrated, quit for a year and sit on their duffs until disgust
drives them back to another excessive and unmaintainable spurt of
gym-going. They are yoyo exercisers. So forget progress. Maintenance
is harder than progress. Maintenance is more necessary than
progress. Progress is intrinsically temporary and you need to mentally
budget for that fact. Very few people do. This isn't the stock market,
you don't need double digit growth (and you certainly don't need
crashes). 14 minutes a weekday for the rest of your life will keep you
fit. There will be progress, slow and maybe even imperceptable. Then
there will be a plateau. Stay on the plateau. You're fit. It's a nice
comfortable place. Who do you want to be, anyway, Charles Atlas?</p>

<p>Sledgehammers do come in a number of different sizes (mine is 12
pounds, I've seen them from 8 to 20), so
you can upgrade to a bigger one after a while, but I'd be very
cautious about doing so. If you can't not upgrade, you're inevitably
going to downgrade -- to nothing. I used my original 12 pounder for a
solid year before permitting myself to <a href="/group/8.html">move up
to 16 pounder</a>, and I still go back to it now and then. But
whatever you do, keep the 14 minutes sacred.</p>

<p>If you're too lazy to <a href="http://www.urbanranger.com/">urban
ranger</a> over to your local hardware store, or they don't have quite
what you want, we'd be delighted if someone would actually buy
something through the shovelglove <a href="/store/">sledgehammer
store.</a></p>




<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The story has a happy ending -- so far. Shovelglove actually seems
to work, for me, at least. I've been doing it for over three years now
and have gotten terrifically strong and lean, by ordinary
non-professional-athlete standards. The only other exercise I do is <a
href="http://www.urbanranger.com">walk</a> (I say only, but I think <a
href="http://www.urbanranger.com">walking</a> is even more important
for long term health than shovelglove). I should mention that I also
have a <a href="http://www.nosdiet.com">sensible diet</a>.</p>

<h2>Is it Dangerous?</h2>

<p>Swinging a sledgehammer around like a spastic maniac is
dangerous. But I haven't found anything to suggest that these
movements, when properly performed by sane, healthy people, are
especially risky. In fact, I've found some reputable sources
specifically extolling the health benefits of shoveling (footnote
pending).</p>

<p>People do have heart attacks and throw out their backs while
shoveling. But these are almost invariably fat lazy slobs who,
unaccustomed to regular exercise, put down their remote and their beer
and get off their couch once a year or so after a snowstorm, to engage
in the intensive, and severely underestitmated, business of clearing
their driveway. Shovelglove builds up the very muscles these people
sorely lack. If their backs and hearts were as nearly as strong as
they should be, there would be no danger. There is no reason that a
healthy human being should not be able to shovel a driveway (real or
imaginary), and benefit from doing so.</p>

<p>Be careful and listen to your body. Start slowly, and crank it up
only as you feel comfortable. Shovelglove shouldn't hurt. If something
does, stop immediately, and take the next day off. Pay attention to
what it was that hurt. Chances are you were careless or overdoing
it. Don't do it again. If it hurts again, maybe you misdiagnosed the
problem. Stop, rest, think, and try again. If it keeps hurting then
maybe shovelglove is not for you.</p>

<p>Low rep sets are also helpful in avoiding injury -- I'd recommend
doing just 7 reps of each movement per set until you feel very
comfortable with them, then gradually crank it up if you're so
inclined (or not, I still do 7 rep sets at least a couple days a
week).</p>

<p>Remember, you have legs; the shoveling and wood chopping movements
are much more back-friendly if you use them.</p>

<p>Fortunately no one has reported injuring themselves yet. But more
than one newbie has gotten seriously, uncomfortably sore by overdoing
it in the beginning. To quote from a recent <a
href="/group/528.html">post</a>
to the shovelglove group:</p>

<blockquote>
Your website does a good job of encouraging a
gradual and careful start, but maybe a big red note
would be helpful for clueless people 
like me, saying <span style="color:red;">IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO WORKING YOUR
ARMS, DON'T START WITH 14 MINUTES.</span>
</blockquote>

<p>This might be a funny site, but it's a seriously hard exercise. If
you go all out for 14 minutes on day one, you are not going to have a
fun day two. Go slow. There's no rush. Use a broom instead of a
sledgehammer to get a feel for the movements. Don't feel compelled to
do the full 14 minutes right away. Get your feet wet before jumping
in. And if you do go the full 14, don't feel compelled to go all out
the whole time. Even just standing around sort of halfheartedly
jiggling the shovelglove (or broom) for 14 minutes fulfills the habit
  forming part of the exercise.</p>

<p  style="color:red;">Note: In October 2021, after 20+ years of injury-free shovelglove, I managed to have
a shovelglove-relevant (if not shovelglove caused) injury. More
details about the injury and my recovery in this <a href="https://everydaysystems.com/podcast/episode/69/">everyday systems
podcast episode</a> 


<h2>Shovelglove routines</h2>

<p>Which movements should you do? How many times? And in what order?
Honestly, I don't think it's that important. Keep swinging that slege
for 14 minutes every weekday, and you'll get a great workout. The one
thing I would caution against is diving into very high rep count sets
right away -- it's safer and more interesting to do smaller rep count
sets, going through a variety of different moves. Try starting with
just 7 reps of each movement, repeating sets when you get through them
all until the timer goes off. As I write on the <a
href="/movements/">movements page</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
 By doing just a few reps, you're less likely to overdo any
movement. You'll also probably do them with better form and more
attention. And instead of serially hitting one muscle group after
another, you keep them all in a nice glow throughout the workout. It's
more full body the whole time. Because you're pretty much guaranteed
to hit every movement once before the timer goes off, you'll be better
about actually stopping when it does, and feeling satisfied with what
you've done. Lastly, as a beginner it gives you a lower risk way to
sample all the movements. Different people find different movements
hard... You might find you want to skip some
movements altogether. Better to make this decision on rep 7 than on an
agonized rep 50. </blockquote>

<p>New: After a mere 14 years I finally got my act together to produce
a full 14 minute workout video you can follow along with (it's a
"routine of sevens," like I just described). Sorry about the wind
noise. Sorry also I couldn't fit quite two complete cycles of
movements in -- talking through the movements messed with my timing a
bit. Consider it an unintentionally forceful illustration of "respect
the timer?" </p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8aBu4xIZRA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>If you're interested in other people's routines or in sharing your
own, I've recently set up a
<a href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=12">routines
forum</a> for this on the bulletin board.</p>


<h2>Freestyle Shovelglove</h2>

<p>Sometimes I get tired of my regular movements. Then I use part of
my 14 minutes for experimentation. 14 minutes and the shovelglove are
the only hard parameters, so this is completely kosher. I jab, I push,
I pivot. I play sledgehammer-kendo. Occassionally, very occasionally,
I come up with a new regular (most recently/notably, <a
href="movements/drive_fence_posts/">driving fence posts</a>). And I hit
plenty of oddball muscles that leave me pleasantly aching. Freestyling
comes at a price. It's plenty fun, but exhausting. I can never keep it
up for more than a few minutes, then it's back to the routine. And
remember, free, not spastic.</p>


<h2>Shovelglove evolution</h2>

<p>The particulars (which movements, how many reps and sets) of my
routine have changed a little over the months, as I've experimented
and gotten stronger. Although I don't hold these particulars to be of
great importance, compared to the principles of schedualistically
insignificant time and useful movements, in the interest of full
disclosure, I've recorded <a href="/routines/evolution/">a rough
chronology of how my routine has changed</a>. (note that these are NOT
the routines I recommend for beginners, just what I actually,
historically did)</p>

<p>Shovelglove historians might be interested in the <a
href="images/shovelglove_design.png">original design
document</a>. Like most such things, it was unnecessarily
complicated. The idea was to make it portable.</p>

<h2><a id="scenario"></a>Scenario Based Shovelglove</h2>

<p>This brilliant idea was recently posted to the shovelglove group (which you should <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=4">join
now</a> to keep apprised of further brilliant ideas like this):
instead of cobbling together a routine of interesting but unrelated
movements, imagine a common theme or story to tie them together. For
example: <a
href="/group/67.html">preparing
the defences</a> or <a
href="/group/71.html">defending
the walls</a> (the more pacifistically inclined may wish to dream up
less martial examples). Such scenarios engage your imagination not
just at the level of the movement, but at the higher level of the
routine. Your workout becomes not only "not boring," but positively
interesting, a little adventure every morning. Alternating scenarios
from day to day provides variety and preempts boredom. You'll have a
focus to inspire new movements, and new ways to interpret old
ones.</p>

<p>This is so new that I haven't had a chance to try it myself yet,
but as you can tell from my gushing tone, I'm pretty optimistic.</p>

<p>Thank you Allan (and sons) for coming up with this!</p>

<p>Allan recently posted a <a href="/group/79.html">farming</a>
scenario, which it occurs to me probably fits best with the
traditional movements described on this site. So if you're doing
vanilla shovelglove, think of this as your scenario.</p>



<h2>The Future of Shovelglove</h2>

<p>I was briefly tempted to "productize" the shovelglove into some
kind of infomercial scam, but that would violate the whole spirit and
charm of the thing. You don't need some prefabricated plastic piece of
junk. Go to the hardware store around the corner and make your own
shovelglove. Worst case scenario you wind up with a useful tool lying
around the house. I live in a city and yes, I've found uses for
it. Consult the film <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258000">Panic
Room</a> for other possible uses (I don't think the intruder would
have gotten up if Jodie Foster had been doing shovelglove).</p>

<p>If you feel sorry for me because I wasn't unscrupulous enough to
get rich off this, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/everydaysyste-20">buy
anything from amazon.com through this link</a>. I'll get a tiny cut,
and you won't pay anything extra. Don't know what to buy? You can gawk
at the ridiculous things other people have bought <a
href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/amazon_earnings.cgi">here</a>. Since
you're reading this page, you might have similarly ridiculous tastes.</p>

<p>Sorry for me or not, <a href="mailto:reinhard.engels@gmail.com">let
me know</a> if you are using the shovelglove system. It won't take
many emails for me to feel that the few hours I spent tinkering around
with this site were worth it.</p>

<p>The only big to-do, besides posting some more pictures, is to
investigate shovelglove music. I think that shovelglove might be even
more satisfying while listening to old labor songs, Conan the
Barbarian music, etc. I used to listen to books or lectures or plays
on tape that I checked out from the library, but more recently it's <a
href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/349191034X/qid=1037573142/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/302-8298731-8846460">Struwwelpeter</a>.</p>

<p>I'd also like to take infared pictures of myself while doing
shovelglove to see which muscles are getting hit hardest, and which
are being neglected, but I have a feeling that could get
expensive.</p>


<h2><a id="saying"></a>What are other people saying about Shovelglove?</h2>

<p>Well, a surprising number of people have posted to the <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/">shovelglove bulletin
board</a>. Some have even been happy enough with the results to submit
<a href="testimonials.html">testimonials</a>.</p>

<p>Mistess Krista of the women's weight training site <a
href="http://www.stumptuous.com/">Stumptuous.com</a> proves that
shovelglove isn't just for Big Dudes, in funny, thoughtful, and
well-photographed articles about creating a home gym <a
href="http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=47">with</a>
or <a
href="http://www.stumptuous.com/cms/displayarticle.php?aid=63">without</a>
weights.</p>

<p>I am relieved to read that people with ACTUAL FITNESS CREDENTIALS
like <a
href="http://www.healthandfitnessadvice.com/fitness-tip/hardcore-fitness-tip--sledgehammer-training-is-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.html">Sal
Marinello</a> and <a
href="http://www.everydaysystems.com/interviews/">Jason White</a>
don't think I'm too far off base.</p>

<p>Personal trainer Arnel Ricafranca has a video of himself doing
traditional and novel shovelglove moves to obvious good effect on his
site <a
href="http://www.iwantsixpackabs.com/my_video_tips/sledgehammer.html">iwantsixpackabs.com</a></p>

<p>Even surprisingly famous people like Stephen J. Dubner of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061234001/everydaysyste-20">Freakonomics</a>
fame have <a
href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/08/30/is-this-the-future-of-home-excercise/">taken
notice of shovelglove</a>.</p>

<p>But I think what makes me happiest of all is the news I recently
heard that, spearheaded by the efforts of a 75 year old shovelglove
cover crotcheting grandmother, <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=5167">a whole
village in Thailand has taken up shovelglove</a>. UPDATE (2009-07-01): make that <a
href="http://everydaysystems.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=62354#62354">two villages</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="mods"></a>Shovelglove mods</h2>

<p>People frequently post questions to the bulletin board about adding
extra weight to their shovelglove. Generally, my advice is to just buy
a heavier hammer. Swinging a sledgehammer around is dangerous enough
without having to worry about <a
href="http://shovelglove.com/group/195.html">extra weights flying
off</a> or the <a href="http://shovelglove.com/group/591.html">handle
snapping</a>. Plus, as I mentioned in the "progress trap" section
above, diddling with the weights all the time is bad psychology.</p>

<p>But if you can't get a heavier hammer for whatever reason, feel
like you're really ready for an upgrade, and you are ridiculously
handy, you might consider trying something like this <a
href="http://biggerhammer.bravehost.com/">impressive user submitted
mod.</a></p>

<p>Modification is the sincerest form of flattery -- thank you fungus!</p>

<h2>Make straight the way of the Shovelglove</h2>

<p>As much as I'd like to lay claim to complete originality, after 9
months of googling, I'm finally convinced there is no such thing. <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0938045326/everydaysyste-20">Kettlebells</a>
sound somewhat similar and are (except they are more expensive and
take themselves much more seriously), and the kettlebell-derivative <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=clubbell">clubbell</a> sounds and
is even more so. If you like to think of yourself as some grunting
Russian special forces killer, you may want to check these out.</p>

<p>More intriguing (because more historical) are <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=indian+clubs">Indian exercise
clubs</a>.</p>

<p>I was recently pointed to an article on <a
href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070807151734/http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/2003/07/09/cz_af_0709sportintro.html">functional
workouts</a>, exercise that leaves you fit for something instead
merely beefing you up. Sounds a lot like "useful movements," in
shovelglovespeak (there is a subtle but important distinction, which I
describe <a href="useful_vs_functional.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Despite my sniping, I'm not disheartened by these discoveries. I'm
encouraged. What these systems share with shovelglove is mere
mechanics. Frankly, I'm a little relieved to hear I'm not way off base
in that department. What they lack is the spiritual underpinnings, the
charm, and the $25 price point at home depot. They giveth, but they
taketh not away.</p>
